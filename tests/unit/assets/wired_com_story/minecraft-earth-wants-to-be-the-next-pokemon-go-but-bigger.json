{"authors": ["Peter Rubin"], "category": "culture", "content": "The gaming world may seem like it\u2019s ruled by _Fortnite_, but _[Minecraft](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/minecraft-addict/)_ continues to be a phenomenon. In the 10 years since [the very first Java edition](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_Classic) went public, it\u2019s sold 176 million copies. More than 90 million people play it every month, and that number has gone up every year, boosted most recently by 200 million Chinese users. Between PCs, game consoles, mobile, and VR devices, you can buy it for 20 different platforms. Videos of people playing the open-ended sandbox game still get tens of _billions_ of views every year on YouTube.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s also a decade old. While Microsoft has made significant updates nearly every year since acquiring the game from original developer Mojang in 2012, there\u2019s never been a _new_ Minecraft. (There was episodic point-and-click title _Minecraft: Story Mode_, sure, and dungeon-crawling adventure game _Minecraft: Dungeons_ is coming to PC later this year, but neither of those delivers the core building experience that defines the game.) So how do you do something new that the whole world can play? You put it out in the world.\n\n_Minecraft Earth_, which Microsoft announces today, is an augmented-reality-driven mobile game that blockifies the planet. When it comes out later this summer, iOS and Android users will be able to construct a \u201cbuild,\u201d as the block-based environments are known, anywhere they want\u2014on a tabletop, on their couch, on the floor\u2014and even invite their friends to help. When they\u2019re done, they can make that build life-size and walk around inside it. Out in the world, in parks and at other landmarks, players can take part in short adventures by themselves or with anyone else in the area, then use the spoils to level up their character and make their build even more impressive. It\u2019s a massive undertaking that quite literally covers the entire globe in _Minecraft_ \u2014and is the biggest step yet taken toward the two-ply world of shared, persistent augmented reality.\n\nAs soon as Saxs Persson joined the _Minecraft_ team in 2015, he started thinking about AR possibilities. At the time, Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens headset was in development, and Persson and some of his colleagues helped create [a demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19W-KD2XzFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19W-KD2XzFE) in which he plopped a _Minecraft_ village onto a table, poking his head inside houses and even looking underground.\n\nWhat the demo didn\u2019t show was that the team also had a similar experience scaled up to life-size. Back in the _Minecraft_ offices in Redmond, Washington, where they shared a building with _Halo_ studio 343 Industries, the team would put people in the HoloLens and then send AR sheep walking down the hallway toward them\u2014\u201cslowly, certainly not threateningly,\u201d Persson says now, sitting in a conference room right next to that hallway. Invariably, every single person was so immersed that they would move out of the way to let the blocky _Minecraft_ sheep pass.\n\nSomething clicked for Persson (who bears no relation to _Minecraft_ creator and Mojang co-founder Markus \u201cNotch\u201d Persson). The HoloLens obviously wasn\u2019t a perfect device\u2014it was an enterprise device, it was expensive, and its pinchy-wavey gestural controls didn\u2019t really map well to _Minecraft_ \u2014but it accomplished something magical. It made _Minecraft_ come to life. Still, technical obstacles abounded, so the team put the idea aside until July 2017, when a discussion with the United Nations about using _Minecraft_ to help people visualize community development made Persson realize that smartphones might be ready to deliver a true AR experience. He began discussing the idea with Mojang chief creative officer Jens Bergensten, even flying to Stockholm the next month and dragging him around the city for hours while they waved their phones and brainstormed.\n\nThey knew what they wanted; they just didn\u2019t know how to make it happen. In order for multiple people to be able to see the same thing in the same place\u2014say, a _Minecraft_ pig standing in front of a fountain\u2014you need to be able to permanently establish the pig\u2019s location in the real world, what\u2019s called an anchor. At the time, there simply wasn\u2019t a way to create a permanent anchor that could then be triggered by anyone visiting that particular spot. \u201cName a Fortune 500 tech company,\u201d Persson says. \u201cI probably asked them, \u2018Hey, are you working on this?\u2019\u201d Nobody was.\n\nUntil they were. Just before Christmas 2017, _Minecraft_ director of engineering Michael Weilbacher went to Persson about a rumor he\u2019d heard. Apparently, some researchers working with Alex Kipman\u2014the person who had [headed up the HoloLens development](https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-hololens-2-headset/) and who oversees some of the company\u2019s leading-edge work in AI\u2014were setting out to solve exactly the problem Persson had. In January 2018, Persson and Kipman made a handshake deal: Each of them would form a team to tackle the issue, and they\u2019d see what they could do.\n\nPersson, by now creative director of _Minecraft_, took a handful of folks to a separate office in a different building. \u201cVery undisclosed,\u201d says game director Torfi Olafsson, who joined the project in February after 18 years at _EVE Online_. \u201cWindowless room, no markings, double layer of security.\u201d They called it The Dungeon. For the first six or eight months of 2018, no one outside the two teams knew about the existence of The Dungeon, let alone what its purpose was. The purpose, of course, is now known as _Minecraft Earth._\n\nSmartphones have come a long way since 2015\u2014[both in price](https://www.wired.com/story/should-i-spend-1000-on-a-smartphone/https://www.wired.com/story/should-i-spend-1000-on-a-smartphone/) (boo) and in their ability to deliver a [compelling AR experience](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-wwdc-augmented-reality-wearables) (yay). By now, Android and iOS offer robust AR development tools, and ever-improving sensors and computer vision algorithms deliver a higher frame rate without draining your battery quite so enthusiastically. _Minecraft Earth_ wrings every last bit out of all those things. I was able to try out a few different aspects of the game, which is still in its pre-beta stages, and each delivered AR experiences I have yet to see outside of a dedicated headset like HoloLens or Magic Leap.\n\nIn the game\u2019s Create mode, I collaborated with Olafsson and others on a test build. After Olafsson placed the build on a table, I could walk around the table to examine it from any angle, adding materials from my own inventory or even re-mining what had already been added to the construction. Multiplayer building is only possible if your friends are in your real-world location, and you\u2019ll have to give them permission to access your build.\n\nPlacing a block in your build. (Magical vapor trail not included.)\n\nOnce you\u2019re done building, you can scale your build up to life-size, put it anywhere you want, and invite people to enjoy it in Play mode. Elsewhere in the studio offices, I maneuvered through a multilevel build, opening doors and setting off traps while blocky villagers rolled by on mine carts, even launching fireworks that had been left there for me\u2014all through my phone while I crouched and spun my way through the room. It all looked exactly like _Minecraft_, and it all behaved exactly like _Minecraft._ \u201cEverything you know about _Minecraft_ applies here,\u201d says Jesse Merriam, the game\u2019s executive producer. \u201cWith redstone and pistons, you can make anything your heart desires.\u201d While changes made in Create mode are permanent, those in Play mode aren\u2019t; it\u2019s one of a few ways the team is hoping to head off griefing or willful sabotage, which [isn\u2019t exactly a rare thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np4NoAiVJ0chttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np4NoAiVJ0c) in regular _Minecraft._ (Of course, that means friends you\u2019ve invited to Create mode can sneak into your build. \u201cIt\u2019s like vampires,\u201d Olafsson says. \u201cIf you invited me in, it\u2019s kind of on you.\u201d)\n\nThe other primary gameplay component is shared far more widely. Pull up _Minecraft Earth_ on your phone, as I did walking around downtown Redmond with some of the developers, and you\u2019ll see a map of your surroundings, rendered in friendly abstractions and dotted with various tappable icons. Anything you tap, from common materials to rare precious gems, gets added to your inventory\u2014and you\u2019re gonna need it. You don\u2019t start _Minecraft Earth_ with a bag full of resources; you collect them yourself.\n\nIf you see multiple icons in a location, that signals an \u201cadventure,\u201d a six- to eight-minute vignette you can play, along with whoever else happens to be there with you. These spawn dynamically and are procedurally generated, so you\u2019ll likely never do the same adventure twice. (They also reset, so if you don\u2019t feel like playing with anyone, wait \u2019em out until you can do it yourself.) Some are dungeons, some are peaceful. Maybe you need to shoot some skeletons with a bow and arrow to find some treasure, maybe you need to collaborate to build something. When you\u2019re doing it months before the game comes out, though, you need to be subtle. \u201cWe like to pretend we\u2019re playing _Pok\u00e9mon Go_,\u201d says Jessica Zahn, principal program manager on the game.\n\nWhich brings us to the 800-pound Pikachu in the room. The obvious comparison here is Niantic\u2019s _Pok\u00e9mon Go,_ as well as the forthcoming game _Harry Potter: Wizards Unite._ Both turn the real world into a treasure map for you to explore, and both are able to bring virtual creatures into your non-virtual surroundings. However, the AR functionality in both is optional. If you turn it off, you\u2019ve essentially got two location-based collecting games. _Minecraft Earth_ makes AR its very essence, and not just AR\u2014shared, persistent AR. In other words, it might just be the first wide-scale mass experience with one foot planted squarely in [the Mirrorworld](https://www.wired.com/story/mirrorworld-ar-next-big-tech-platform/https://www.wired.com/story/mirrorworld-ar-next-big-tech-platform/).\n\n\u201cWe started with the basic idea of _Minecraft_ in real life,\u201d Persson says. \u201cWe don't want a flavor of it. We don't want some of it. We don't want a compromise. We want everything you've ever learned in _Minecraft_ to be in real life. There's no other way. There's no desktop mode. It\u2019s about people being together. Whenever we limit it, make it smaller, the whole team pushes against it.\u201d\n\nMoreover, _Minecraft Earth_ doesn\u2019t use GPS. Instead, it uses something called Azure Spatial Anchors, which leverage [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/38.007/-95.844https://www.openstreetmap.org/%23map=5/38.007/-95.844) and Microsoft\u2019s massive Azure cloud system to generate hundreds of millions of locations around the planet where players can interact with the game. (Seattle alone has more than 100,000.) Not only are these \u201cfeature points\u201d more precise than GPS, which has a sizable error radius, but they\u2019re able to include data like altitude, which enables the game to distinguish between a location at sidewalk level and something that might be on an upper floor of a building. Over time, as more people visit feature points, their specific anonymized locations\u2014and the angles from which they view the feature points\u2014help refine the data even further.\n\nThis is all still a work in progress, of course. A closed beta will launch this summer, with the full game coming later this year. I saw nothing concrete about how your character might level up, though Olafsson says that specialization will be part of it, and while the game is free to play, the team isn\u2019t talking about exactly how they\u2019ll monetize it\u2014other than to vow there will be absolutely no loot boxes. Even if the topic had come up at some point, this is _Minecraft_, so there was only one thing to do with the idea: Block it.\n\nWith more than 100,000,000 players and 54,000,000 units sold, Minecraft is one of the biggest video games on the planet. Just how big? We break down the numbers behind the wildly popular game.\n\n", "image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/5cddd4cae0f5024732d1a36c/master/w_2400,c_limit/culture_minecraft_top.jpg", "published": "2019-05-17", "tags": ["AR", "augmented reality", "Microsoft", "Minecraft"], "title": "Minecraft Earth Wants to Be the Next Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2014But Bigger"}
