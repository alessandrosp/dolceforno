Science fiction fans bristled, questioning whether McEwan had ever actually read any science fiction, but McEwan now insists that he\u2019s been misunderstood.\n\n\u201cI was a little taken aback at how some rather offhand remarks of mine should cause such a storm,\u201d McEwan says in Episode 359 of the [_Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy_](http://www.geeksguideshow.com) podcast. \u201cAnd actually I\u2019ve read a fair amount of science fiction over a lifetime.\u201d\n\nAmong the science fiction authors that he\u2019s read and enjoyed are Philip K. Dick, Walter M. Miller, Brian Aldiss, Ursula K. Le Guin, Frank Herbert, Stanislaw Lem, Tom Disch, and Olaf Stapledon. McEwan is also a great fan of the movie [_Blade Runner_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner), which is referenced in _Machines Like Me_.\n\n\u201cI actually put a nod towards _Blade Runner_ in Adam\u2019s final speeches, after he\u2019s been attacked by Charlie,\u201d McEwan says. \u201cThere\u2019s a very self-conscious nod to that famous farewell in the rain.\u201d\n\nAnd while science fiction works like _Blade Runner_ are a definite influence on _Machines Like Me_, McEwan notes that there are many other influences as well. \u201cI\u2019d be very happy for my novel to be called science fiction, but it\u2019s also a counterfactual novel, it\u2019s also a historical novel, it\u2019s also a moral dilemma novel, in a well-established traditional form within the literary novel,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m very happy if they want to call my novel science fiction, even honored. But it\u2019s much else, that\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to say.\u201d\n\nUltimately he feels that literary categories are increasingly unhelpful and shouldn\u2019t be taken too seriously.\n\n\u201cScience fiction writers and thriller writers and traditional so-called \u2018literary\u2019 novelists are all novelists,\u201d he says, \u201cand they finally have to be judged on how good they are, not on which category they belong in.\u201d\n\nListen to the complete interview with McEwan in Episode 359 of _Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy_ (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.\n\n**Ian McEwan on new technology:**\n\n\u201cWe get used to [new technology] with astonishing rapidity. I remember being in Manhattan some years ago and seeing a huge line down the street\u2014maybe 400 yards, around the block\u2014and I asked my friend what was going on. I thought maybe [Van Morrison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Morrison) was in town or something. But no, they were lining up for an iPhone 4 or 5. You ask yourself now, where are all those iPhone 4s and 5s? They\u2019re at the bottom of your sock drawer, or they\u2019re in the hands of your grandchildren, who are playing games on them. They\u2019ve just become yesterday\u2019s junk. \u2026 We\u2019re like children on Christmas Day opening presents. They open one and barely absorb it before there\u2019s the excitement of opening another. So I think we\u2019re rather like children in that respect.\u201d\n\n**Ian McEwan on autonomous vehicles:**\n\n\u201cWe should rightly feel uneasy, that even though we\u2019re pretty clumsy in [emergencies], handing over that responsibility is a big step. \u2026 [What happened with [the Boeing 737 MAX](https://www.wired.com/story/boeing-737-max-8-ethiopia-crash-faa-ground-safety/)] rather reminded me of the last moments of [_2001: A Space Odyssey_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_\\(film\\)), talking to HAL, when HAL has made his decision. So I think we will really need to be having conversations about moral decision-taking and what we hand over.\u201d\n\n**Ian McEwan on biology:**\n\n\u201cI decided\u2014having been asked if I\u2019d write the follow-up to [_The Fly_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fly_\\(1986_film\\))\u2014to try to base it as closely as possible on contemporary knowledge. I found a book called _How to Make a Fly_ \u2014although that fly was not a housefly, as in the movie, it was a fruit fly. But I tried to build [the script] around, as much as possible, a proper understanding of genetics. That was in the mid-\u201990s, and how quickly what I knew fell out of date. I remember my son William went to study biology at the University College in London, and he showed me [a note] right at the beginning of his course that said, \u2018Please don\u2019t read anything about genetics before 1997.\u2019 Now, we were in the year 2001, so the speed with which that subject was changing was astonishing.\u201d\n\n**Ian McEwan on literary categories:**\n\n\u201cI think that the novel\u2014and I think we should usually talk about \u2018the novel\u2019 rather than \u2018the literary novel\u2019 or \u2018the science fiction novel\u2019\u2014but the novel is a very good means of examining colossal social change, but also of [examining] the moral dilemmas that new technologies are going to make us confront. I think there could be a resurgence, a revitalization, of the form, in which\u2014quite possibly\u2014concepts and categories of \u2018literary\u2019 novels up against \u2018science fiction\u2019 novels will completely vanish, because we\u2019ll need the technical grasp of technologies that the best science fiction yields to us, and we\u2019ll need the traditional examinations of moral dilemmas that the literary novel has always prided itself upon. So I look forward to these categories just dissolving.\u201d\n\n", "image": "https://assets.wired.com/photos/w_1500/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Culture_GeeksGuide_IanMcEwan.jpg", "published": "2019-05-04", "tags": ["Geek's Guide to the Galaxy", "Sci-fi", "science fiction"], "title": "Ian McEwan Doesn\u2019t Hate Science Fiction"}
