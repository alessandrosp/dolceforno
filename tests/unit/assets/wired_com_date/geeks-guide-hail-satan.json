{"authors": ["Geek's Guide to the Galaxy"], "category": "Culture", "content": "Because The Satanic Temple doesn\u2019t believe in a literal Satan, or in anything supernatural, it\u2019s often presented in the media as a joke religion like the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster or the Church of the SubGenius. But Penny Lane, director of the new documentary [_Hail Satan?_](https://www.hailsatanfilm.com/), says that\u2019s a total misconception.\n\n\u201cThe Satanic Temple would very much like for people to, perhaps, learn to judge other people based on their actions, not based on what they look like, or what you might have heard about them on daytime television,\u201d Lane says in Episode 361 of the [_Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy_](http://www.geeksguideshow.com) podcast.\n\nThe group is best known for their activism on the issue of separation of church and state. One scene in the film shows the Temple\u2019s spokesperson, [Lucien Greaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Greaves), strapping on a bulletproof vest before appearing beside the group\u2019s controversial [statue of Baphomet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphomet_\\(sculpture\\)). Lane says that sort of risk-taking demonstrates real devotion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an either/or proposition,\u201d she says. \u201cYes, they are internet trolls and pranksters, and they really are Satanists. Both of those things are true. Because the core of Satanism is to embrace joking and pranking and being mischievous and freaking people out. That\u2019s the heart of the religious identity. It\u2019s not evidence that they\u2019re insincere. It\u2019s actually part of it.\u201d\n\nLane also says it\u2019s not unusual for religious movements to have humble beginnings. \u201cProbably many of the religions that we now take for granted as being \u2018real\u2019 started out with cons or press conferences or lying or magic tricks,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s good marketing. But then once you get there, what do the ideas have to offer? People don\u2019t stick around for Satanism just because it\u2019s funny. People stick around because\u2014for a person who is a Satanist\u2014Satanism brings them a great deal of meaning and value.\u201d\n\nAnd just as the Satanic Temple uses humor to communicate a serious message, Lane hopes that her documentary does the same.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really something to behold when you see these crowds walking out of a theater with these gigantic smiles on their faces,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause they\u2019ve obviously had this fun experience that\u2019s given them joy and uplift and inspiration. But there\u2019s also kind of this strange look on their face\u2014of concern\u2014because they\u2019re really trying to figure out if they\u2019re a Satanist or not, and they\u2019ve never had to ask that question before.\u201d\n\nListen to the complete interview with Penny Lane in Episode 361 of _Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy_ (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.\n\n**Penny Lane on Ten Commandments monuments:**\n\n\u201cThe monuments were created to look like the stone tablets that are carried down by Charlton Heston in the Cecil B. DeMille film [_The Ten Commandments_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ten_Commandments_\\(1956_film\\)). It\u2019s a particular design that was made by a civic group in the 1950s, but the promotion and spread and creation of those monuments was funded and supported in part by Paramount pictures as kind of a tie-in with their film. \u2026 It\u2019s really reminiscent of other monument battles, like with the Confederate monument battles as well, where it seems like these are from a really old time in American history that we should preserve, but often you see that they\u2019re quite new, and they don\u2019t have the cultural heritage and history behind them that we\u2019re told they have.\u201d\n\n**Penny Lane on the[Satanic Panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_ritual_abuse#As_a_moral_panic):**\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re a high school teacher in a small town, and someone comes up with these crazy accusations that you\u2019re part of a Satanic cult and you\u2019ve been raping children after school or something. In most cases what would happen is that person would just leave town. They would quit their job\u2014or get fired\u2014and no charges were filed, but they have had their life fairly well disrupted or ruined, and their reputation disrupted or ruined as well. There are countless stories like that that we\u2019ll never really know the numbers on because we don\u2019t have court records or something to refer to. So the nature of the problem was actually so extensive that it\u2019s hard to even measure the impact of it.\u201d\n\n**Penny Lane on free speech:**\n\n\u201cThere are all kinds of people, on all sides of all political and cultural divides, that don\u2019t understand what the [First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) is actually for. And this idea of being offended\u2014the idea that someone would say something that upsets you, and your desire to want to shut that down\u2014is quite natural. We all experience the feeling of it. You just want to be like, \u2018Hey shut up, that\u2019s awful. That hurts my feelings. That goes against what I was taught in school or taught in church.\u2019 But the reality of it is that the First Amendment is there to protect precisely that kind of speech, because you don\u2019t need some kind of law to protect the speech of people who are popular and saying popular things.\u201d\n\n**Penny Lane on the statue of Baphomet:**\n\n\u201cThe meaning of these symbols and ideas and mythologies and images can change very rapidly. So it\u2019s not a crazy idea to think that in a hundred years the Baphomet monument\u2014that the Satanic Temple made as part of their Ten Commandments campaign\u2014that someone could look at that monument and instantly know that the meaning of that monument is not death and torture and destruction and worshiping the devil, but in fact the meaning of that monument is religious pluralism, the importance of embracing blasphemy, and standing up for what is just in the face of extreme opposition. It\u2019s not a crazy idea that that\u2019s what Satan could come to mean in the cultural conversation.\u201d\n\n", "image": "https://assets.wired.com/photos/w_1500/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Culture_GeeksGuide_HailSatan.jpg", "published": "2019-05-18", "tags": ["Geek's Guide to the Galaxy"], "title": "The Satanic Temple Is No Laughing Matter"}
