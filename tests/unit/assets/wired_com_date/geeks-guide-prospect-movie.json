{"authors": ["Geek's Guide to the Galaxy"], "category": "Culture", "content": "The indie science fiction film [_Prospect_](https://www.wired.com/story/diy-sci-fi-prospect/), directed by [Zeek Earl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeek_Earl) and [Chris Caldwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Caldwell), shows that you don\u2019t need $100 million to make a first-rate space opera. Horror author [Christopher M. Cevasco](http://www.christophermcevasco.com) was surprised that the movie looks as good as it does.\n\n\u201cIf I had just seen this movie in a vacuum and wasn\u2019t told it was a low-budget film, I wouldn\u2019t have thought that it was,\u201d Cevasco says in Episode 360 of the [_Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy_](http://www.geeksguideshow.com) podcast. \u201cIt seemed high-budget to me. They did a lot with a little.\u201d\n\nOne way that Earl and Caldwell are able to stretch their budget is by setting most of the action in the wilderness. Science fiction author [Rajan Khanna](http://www.rajankhanna.com) enjoyed how the story, which involves ruthless characters struggling over a scarce resource, resembles a classic Western. \n\n\u201cIt replicated the idea of what it must have been like back in the day, where you\u2019re just camping in the wilderness and all of a sudden a dude rolls up with his six shooters and wants to rob you,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that actually came across to me really starkly about how scary that must be, to not know what\u2019s around the next bend.\u201d\n\nAnother trick the film uses is to pack the dialogue with mysterious references to a wider universe, which creates a sense of epic scale without the need for expensive CGI. \u201cThis is an example of the power of under-explaining,\u201d says writer [Sara Lynn Michener](https://twitter.com/SaraMichener). \u201cTo leave it an enigma is very powerful in a genre where imagination is supposed to be the driver of the audience.\u201d\n\nIn fact it\u2019s likely that _Prospect_ is so strong precisely because of its limited budget. _Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy_ host [David Barr Kirtley](http://www.davidbarrkirtley.com) notes that the script probably wouldn\u2019t have been as polished as it is if Earl and Caldwell hadn\u2019t been under such tight constraints.\n\n\u201cThey were pitching it and getting turned down, and then they would rework the script and rework the pitch and go and do it again,\u201d Kirtley says. \u201cAnd they said that even though that was stressful, they were glad in the end that that\u2019s how it worked out, because it gave them a lot of time to fine-tune everything.\u201d\n\nListen to the complete interview with Christopher M. Cevasco, Rajan Khanna, and Sara Lynn Michener in Episode 360 of _Geek\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy_ (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.\n\n**David Barr Kirtley on Zeek Earl and Chris Caldwell:**\n\n\u201cThey made a short film called [_Into the Pines_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bihDBq2ksbA), which was accepted into [South by Southwest](https://www.sxsw.com/) in 2011. It\u2019s about a teenage girl who hikes out into the woods in anticipation of being picked up by aliens for a second time. When it got into SXSW, a bunch of distributors showed interest in whether they could turn it into a feature, but they had never planned to turn it into a feature. They worked on it for a while, but couldn\u2019t really think of a good way to turn it into a feature, and so they\u2019re like, \u2018OK, let\u2019s make another short film, but this time we\u2019ll plan it from the beginning that we can turn it into a feature.\u2019 And so they made _Prospect_ as a [short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90DI7TOefgM), and that was in 2014, and then it took them a couple years to raise money to finance it as a feature, and then the feature film version came out in 2018.\u201d\n\n**Rajan Khanna on analog technology:**\n\n\u201cI read a few things, right before this podcast, just to see what people were saying about [ _Prospect_ ], and somebody was like, \u2018It takes place in an alternate reality where the \u201960s technology kind of persisted,\u2019 and I didn\u2019t see it that way at all. When I was growing up there would be people who would assemble their own [ham radios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio) using circuits and stuff, and there are always people who put together old cars. I felt like it was that level of technology. I\u2019m sure that there are flashy digital holographic spacecraft out there in this world, but these people can only afford to cobble together what they can cobble together, and the technology is ubiquitous enough that anyone can do it, as long as you have the parts, and maybe they scrounge for them for years.\u201d\n\n**Christopher M. Cevasco on[Pedro Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal):**\n\n\u201cHe just [plays charming and dangerous] so well, whether it\u2019s as [Oberyn Martell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberyn_Martell), or in this movie, or I thought he was phenomenal in [_Narcos_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcos)\u2014he plays Agent Pe\u00f1a in that. And this is true for all the main characters in this film\u2014whether it\u2019s the father or him or anyone\u2014he\u2019s such a morally ambiguous character. The fact that he is so charismatic, as an actor, I think allows him to do this so well. But in all of those venues, with the characters that he plays, he walks a very fine line between bad guy and good guy, but he pulls it off where the audience is just captivated by him while he\u2019s on screen, and you\u2019re very easily won over to his side, even though you initially view him as the enemy.\u201d\n\n**David Barr Kirtley on[Sophie Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Thatcher):**\n\n\u201cThroughout almost the entire movie, it\u2019s just one awful thing happening to Cee after another, and she just has this stony expression, and is so unhappy\u2014for obvious reasons. But around this time there\u2019s a part where she\u2019s been writing in her book, and Ezra asks her, \u2018What are you writing?\u2019 And she talks about how she had this favorite novel that she would read over and over again, and she lost it, so she\u2019s been making a new version of it as best she can from memory. And the way that her face comes alive when she talks about it was just so moving to me, and it just made me love this character so much. \u2026 Seeing that moment of her glowing with passion, that juxtaposition was just so powerful.\u201d\n\n", "image": "https://assets.wired.com/photos/w_1500/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Prospect3.jpg", "published": "2019-05-11", "tags": ["Geek's Guide to the Galaxy"], "title": "Prospect Is a Master Class in Low-Budget Space Opera"}
