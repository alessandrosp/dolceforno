SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Aging, like bankruptcy in Hemingway’s description, happens two ways, slowly and then all at once. The slow way is the familiar one: decades pass with little sense of internal change, middle age arrives with only a slight slowing down—a name lost, a lumbar ache, a sprinkling of white hairs and eye wrinkles. The fast way happens as a series of lurches: eyes occlude, hearing dwindles, a hand trembles where it hadn’t, a hip breaks—the usually hale and hearty doctor’s murmur in the yearly checkup, <em class="">There are some signs here that concern me</em>.</p><p>To get a sense of what it would be like to have the slow process become the fast process, you can go to the AgeLab, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, and put on <em class="small">agnes</em> (for Age Gain Now Empathy System). <em class="small">agnes</em>, or the “sudden aging” suit, as Joseph Coughlin, the founder and director of the AgeLab describes it, includes yellow glasses, which convey a sense of the yellowing of the ocular lens that comes with age; a boxer’s neck harness, which mimics the diminished mobility of the cervical spine; bands around the elbows, wrists, and knees to simulate stiffness; boots with foam padding to produce a loss of tactile feedback; and special gloves to “reduce tactile acuity while adding resistance to finger movements.”</p><p>Slowly pulling on the aging suit and then standing up—it looks a bit like one of the spacesuits that the Russian cosmonauts wore—you’re at first conscious merely of a little extra weight, a little loss of feeling, a small encumbrance or two at the extremities. Soon, though, it’s actively infuriating. The suit bends you. It slows you. You come to realize what makes it a powerful instrument of emotional empathy: every small task becomes effortful. “Reach up to the top shelf and pick up that mug,” Coughlin orders, and doing so requires more attention than you expected. You reach for the mug instead of just getting it. Your emotional cast, as focussed task piles on focussed task, becomes one of annoyance; you acquire the same set-mouthed, unhappy, watchful look you see on certain elderly people on the subway. The concentration that each act requires disrupts the flow of life, which you suddenly become aware is the happiness of life, the ceaseless flow of simple action and responses, choices all made simultaneously and mostly without effort. Happiness is absorption, and absorption is the opposite of willful attention.</p><p>The annoyance, after a half hour or so in the suit, tips over into anger: <em class="">Damn, what’s wrong with the world</em>? (Never: What’s wrong with me?) The suit makes us aware not so much of the physical difficulties of old age, which can be manageable, but of the mental state disconcertingly associated with it—the price of age being perpetual aggravation. The theme and action and motive of <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/074348276X/?tag=thneyo0f-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">King Lear</a> suddenly become perfectly clear. You become enraged at your youngest daughter’s reticence because you have had to struggle to unroll the map of your kingdom.</p><p>The AgeLab is designed to alleviate this progression. It exists to encourage and incubate new technologies and products and services for an ever-larger market of aging people. (“Every eight seconds, a baby boomer turns seventy-three,” Coughlin observes.) Coughlin, who is in his late fifties, is the image of an old-fashioned American engineer-entrepreneur; he is bald in the old-fashioned, tonsured, Thurber-husband way, wears a bow tie and heavy red-framed glasses, and, walking a visitor through the lab, suggests a cross between Mr. Peabody and Q, from the Bond films, showing you the latest gadgets. His talk is crisply aphoristic and irrigated with an easy flow of statistics: each proposition has its instantly associated number.</p><p>“Where science is ambiguous, politics begins,” he says. “In the designation of some states, an older driver is fifty, in some eighty—we don’t even know what an older driver is. That ambiguity is an itch I wanted to scratch. Over the past century, we’ve created the greatest gift in the history of humanity—thirty extra years of life—and we don’t know what to do with it! Now that we’re living longer, how do we plan for what we’re going to do?”</p><p>Having picked the mug up, the suit wearer finds that setting the mug down gently on a nearby table is also a bit of a challenge. So is following Coughlin from room to room as he narrates all that the AgeLab has learned.</p><p>“Here’s a useful model for you,” he says. “From zero to twenty-one is about eight thousand days. From twenty-one to midlife crisis is eight thousand days. From mid-forties to sixty-five—eight thousand days. Nowadays, if you make it to sixty-five you have a fifty-per-cent chance you’ll make it to eighty-five. Another eight thousand days! That’s no longer a trip to Disney and wait for the grandchildren to visit and die of the virus you get on a cruise. We’re talking about rethinking, redefining one-third of adult life! The greatest achievement in the history of humankind—and all we can say is that it’s going to make <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/medicare">Medicare</a> go broke? Why don’t we take that one-third and create new stories, new rituals, new mythologies for people as they age?”</p><p>The <em class="small">agnes</em> suit is one of many instruments and appliances—or “cool toys,” as they are more technically known—that can be found in the AgeLab’s glass-walled halls and cubicled corridors, ready to entertain<span data-page="page_2"></span> visiting writers, and to instruct visiting entrepreneurs. There is the driving simulator, specially fitted to track the driver’s eye movements as they flit back and forth from the dashboard to the horizon. (“With its new technologies, like navigation systems, the automotive industry is asking people to change fifty years of driving habits in ten minutes without instruction,” Coughlin says.) There is Paro, a robotic baby seal, from Japan, which bleats and moves its head, and is designed to act as a comfort to aging people, particularly Alzheimer’s patients struggling with the “sundown” moment at day’s end, when confusion and restlessness become acute. (“It’s a seal, rather than a dog or a cat, because people have great experiences with dogs and cats, and even Alzheimer’s patients can spot the eerie non-resemblance,” Coughlin says. “Having no experience of seals, we accept Paro as he is.”) There are mobile robotic nurses made for elderly care, and broad red upholstered chairs made for elderly rears. There are large research displays showing photographs of drivers, their faces embedded with sensors, and the varieties of “Glance Classification” that can, when analyzed, lead to “Crash Avoidance.” (“The ratio between confident decisions and <em class="">correct</em> confident decisions can be a story of life or death on the highway,” Coughlin explains.) And there are displays of word clouds associated with aging, showing the significant difference between the terms with which women imagine their post-career lives (Freedom, Time, Family) and those which men use (Retirement, Relax, Hobbies).</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>The work of the AgeLab is shaped by a paradox. Having been established to engineer and promote new products and services specially designed for the expanding market of the aged, the AgeLab swiftly discovered that engineering and promoting new products and services specially designed for the expanding market of the aged is a good way of going out of business. Old people will not buy anything that reminds them that they are old. They are a market that cannot be marketed to. In effect, to accept help in getting out of the suit is to accept that we’re in the suit for life. We would rather suffer because we’re old than accept that we’re old and suffer less.</p><p>This paradox is, well, old. Heinz, back in the nineteen-fifties, tried marketing a line of “Senior Foods” that was, essentially, baby food for old people. It not only failed spectacularly but, as Coughlin puts it, poisoned an entire category. The most perverse of these failures is perhaps that of the <em class="small">PERS</em>, or personal-emergency-response system, a category of device—best known for the hysterically toned television ad in which an elderly woman calls out, “I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!”—designed as a neck pendant that summons emergency services when pressed. It is simple and effective. “The problem is that no one wants one,” Coughlin says. “The entire penetration in the U.S. of the sixty-five-plus market is less than four per cent. And a German study showed that, when subscribers fell and remained on the floor for longer than five minutes, they failed to use their devices to summon help eighty-three per cent of the time.” In other words, many older people would sooner thrash on the floor in distress than press a button—one that may summon assistance but whose real impact is to admit, <em class="">I am old</em>.</p><p>“We buy products not just to do jobs but for what they say about us,” Coughlin summarizes. “Beige or light-blue bracelets or pendants say ‘Old Man Walking.’ ”</p><div class="Callout__inset-left___2rZjf" data-type="callout" data-callout="inset-left"><div class="CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM "><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW " href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a22058"><figure class="Figure__figure___U_9Te  "><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholder-buttress"></div><div class="placeholder-content"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5cd47cac3e22812e9dda480d/master/w_280,c_limit/190520_a22058.jpg, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5cd47cac3e22812e9dda480d/master/w_560,c_limit/190520_a22058.jpg 2x"/><source srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5cd47cac3e22812e9dda480d/master/w_727,c_limit/190520_a22058.jpg, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5cd47cac3e22812e9dda480d/master/w_1454,c_limit/190520_a22058.jpg 2x"/><img alt="" src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5cd47cac3e22812e9dda480d/master/w_727,c_limit/190520_a22058.jpg" title=""/></picture></div></div></div><figcaption class="ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5"><span class="ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO">“Don’t let this beautiful weather fool you into thinking everything’s fine.”</span></figcaption></figure></a><div class="CartoonEmbed__socialWrapper___3-ICo"><div class="SocialShare__socialShare___92Ene SocialShare__grey___dItUm CartoonEmbed__socialShare___13L3P"><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__facebook___Jm71k " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa22058&amp;display=popup&amp;ref=plugin"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__twitter___3O6QA " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa22058&amp;text=A%20New%20Yorker%20Cartoon&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa22058"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__email___TlCif " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="email" href="mailto:?subject=From%20newyorker.com:%20A%20New%20Yorker%20Cartoon&amp;body=%E2%80%9CDon%E2%80%99t%20let%20this%20beautiful%20weather%20fool%20you%20into%20thinking%20everything%E2%80%99s%20fine.%E2%80%9D%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa22058"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__shop___1TDi0 " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="shop" data-track-location="cartoon-shop" href="https://condenaststore.com/conde-nast-brand/cartoonbank"></a></div></div></div></div><p>The AgeLab has rediscovered the eternal truth that identity matters to us far more than utility. The most effective way of comforting the aged, the researchers there find, is through a kind of comical convergence of products designed by and supposedly for impatient millennials, which secretly better suit the needs of irascible boomers. The best hearing aids look the most like earbuds. The most effective <em class="small">PERS</em> device is an iPhone or an Apple Watch app.</p><p>Such unexpected convergences have happened in the past. Retirement villages came to be centered on golf courses, Coughlin maintains, not because oldsters necessarily like golf but because they like using golf carts. It’s the carts that supply greater mobility in and around the village. The golf comes with them. This process of “exaptation” has now accelerated. TaskRabbit and Uber and Rent the Runway—services that provide immediate help for specific problems—are especially valuable for an aging population.</p><p>“The dominant paradigm is that older people don’t want new technology,” Coughlin says. “But take the microwave oven! It couldn’t have been better designed for people who live by themselves. It’s a perfect example of what I call ‘transcendent design’—not made for older people, but ideal for them. We’re doing a lot of work in the on-demand economy, which was made for millennials but is working better for boomers. Meals are delivered—these are amazing, assisted-living services that can come to anyone’s house. Older women in particular are saved from microdeficiencies in their diet. So, while the millennials want them for convenience, the boomers want them for care for their parents, or themselves.”</p><p>Coughlin hates what he calls “the narrative,” according to which new tech appeals to newer people: “Startup money goes to youngsters because that’s what startup entrepreneurs are supposed to look like, and the products are designed for kids because that’s what startup products are meant to look like.” In his view—detailed in<span data-page="page_3"></span> his book “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1610396634/?tag=thneyo0f-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Longevity Economy</a>”—the narrative, more than any rational calculation of profit, accounts for the technological gap. “There’s no reason for this enormous prejudice in favor of youthfulness in Silicon Valley and the tech industry,” he says. He also hates the misallocation of resources based on mere myths. “We have a belief that we send out our elderly to institutions. The fact of the matter is that less than ten per cent of the elderly go into nursing homes or assisted living. The senior-housing industry is building inventory meant for seniors, but eighty-seven per cent of retirement-age people want to stay in the same home where they have the three ‘M’s: marriage, mortgage, and memories. The problem is that they can’t. Not when the model is a two-story house with a bedroom and the bathroom upstairs. If we can solve the stairs problem, we won’t need new housing.”</p><p>Coughlin says that having simple answers to two questions can determine whether you’re going to age well in place: “Who’s going to change the light bulb, and how are you going to get an ice-cream cone? Little tasks become sources of high friction. It’s not that you can’t climb the ladder to change the light bulb. But for the first time you are going to have someone yelling at you, ‘You’re going to fall and break your neck!’ That’s the problem of aging we have to tackle, not building more old people’s homes or senior villages.” It’s the failure of industry and engineering to address the actual problems of aging—the problems summed up by the aggravations of the <em class="small">agnes</em> suit—that makes Coughlin impatient with scientific speculations about extending life. “We’ve already extended life! What we need is not to put off death a little longer but to write a new narrative of aging as it could be.”</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Aging has no point; it is the infuriating absence of a point. Having reproduced ourselves externally, we fall down on replicating ourselves internally. The processes of cellular replication that allow us to be boats rebuilt even as they cross the ocean cease acting efficiently, because they have no evolutionary reward for acting efficiently. They are like code monkeys in a failing tech business: they can mess up everything, absent-mindedly forget to code for the color of our hair or the elasticity of our skin, and no penalty is exacted for the failure. We’ve already made all the kids we are going to make.</p><p>That, at least, is the classic explanation of why we age, proposed by the British Nobel laureate Peter Medawar, in the nineteen-fifties. Once we have passed reproductive age, the genes can get sloppy about copying, allowing mutations to accumulate, because natural selection no longer cares. And so things fall apart. The second law of thermodynamics gets us all in the end. The car or the Cuisinart works for a decade, breaks down, and can’t be fixed; rust never sleeps, and we do.</p><p>And yet some trees go on for centuries, collecting rings, growing older without really aging. Some species—though those are often hard-to-track creatures, like Arctic sharks—may live for centuries. Even if aging at some speed is ultimately inevitable, what happens when we age is far from self-evident.</p><p>It may be that the real trick is not how much we age but how much we don’t. Human beings are outliers: we live much longer than other creatures of our size, defying the general truth that smaller animals live shorter lives than bigger ones. (Not that we should take too much pride in our defiance; another great defier is the naked mole rat, the world’s ugliest animal, which often lives for absurdly long periods and scarcely seems to age at all, although one might ask how anyone but another naked mole rat could tell.) Those extra thirty years of life, though won by advances in medicine and public health, are winnable because, given a little chance, we just go on. The big question of human aging then becomes not why we fall apart but why nature lets us hold together for so long.</p><p>One evolutionary rationale is that there is something essential to human groups, with the slowly unfolding infancy of their young, in keeping the old folks around even when they can’t make more young folks. Old folks are repositories of extended cultural memory: it would seem to be advantageous to have a few senior citizens around who know what to do, so to speak, when winter comes. Evolutionary biologists tend to doubt whether nature cares about the fitness of groups, rather than the fitness of individuals, but the model of “kin selection”—which gives weight to the fact that helping my relatives helps preserve my genes—suggests that there might be evolutionary advantages in having grandmothers around to take care of kids and remember where the fish go every twenty years. (Then again, people who do have grandparents around to remind them what they’re doing wrong would probably suspect that killing off the oldsters early might actually make for more success, or at least more serenity.) People might not have a death sentence in their genes.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>And so elsewhere in Cambridge, notably in certain genetic labs at Harvard, the chairs and seals and exaptated services of the AgeLab are regarded as mere Band-Aids on the problem to be solved. Here, there are whispers of undying yeast, tales of eternally<span data-page="page_4"></span> young mice, rumors of rejuvenated dogs, and scientists who stubbornly insist that age is an illness to be treated like any other.</p><p>Where fifty years ago it was taken for granted that the problem of age was a problem of the inevitable running down of everything, entropy working its worst, now many researchers are inclined to think that the problem is “epigenetic”: it’s a problem in reading the information—the genetic code—in the cells. To use a metaphor of the Harvard geneticist David Sinclair, the information in each cell is digital and perfectly stored; it’s the “readout,” the active expression of the information, that’s effectively analogue, and subject to occlusion by the equivalent of dirt and scratches on the plastic surface of a CD. Clear those off, he says, and the younger you, still intact in the information layer, jumps out—just as the younger Beatles jump out from a restored and remastered CD. (It would not be the first time in the history of science that the way we think about a phenomenon has been affected by the kinds of man-made models we’re acquainted with. When a telephone switchboard was our most impressive knowledge-bearing mechanism, people thought that the brain was like one; when Xerox copies, growing less legible as generation passed to generation, were familiar to everyone, the image of a cell ceasing to replicate itself effectively in that manner was self-evident.)</p><p>We don’t have to micromanage the repair, the Harvard molecular biologist George Church observes: “If we think epigenetically, we can see that we can make the cells industriously do the repair themselves.” Already a legendary figure for devising genomic-sequencing techniques—it must help that he’s a scientific eminence who has the aura of one, with a grand Darwinian beard and a slow-spoken orotundity—Church gained further attention for his experiments in trying to resurrect extinct species, particularly the woolly mammoth. (One of his standard jokes is that the fifth floor of his lab is off limits to visitors, because that is where the mammoths and the Neanderthals live.) He is also among a group of engineer-entrepreneurs who are trying not to make better products for aging people but to make fewer aging people to sell products to. Perhaps aging is not a condition to be managed but a mistake to be fixed. Sinclair, for one, has successfully extended the life of yeast, and says that he is moving on to human trials. He is an evangelist for the advantages of what he calls “hormesis”—the practice of inducing metabolic stress by short intense exercise or intermittent fasting. “Every day, try to be hungry and out of breath” is his neatly epigenetic epigram.</p><p>Anti-aging research, in its “translational,” or applied, form, seems to be proceeding along two main fronts: through “small molecules,” meaning mostly dietary supplements that are intended to rev up the right proteins; and, perhaps more dramatically, through genetic engineering. Typically, genetic engineering involves adding or otherwise manipulating genes in a population of animals, often mice, perhaps by rejiggering a mouse’s genome in embryo and then using it to breed a genetically altered strain. In mice studies, genetic modifications that cause the rodents to make greater amounts of a single protein, sirtuin 6, have resulted in longer life spans (although some scientists think that the intervention merely helped male mice to live as long as female mice).</p><p>Church and Noah Davidsohn, a former postdoc in his lab, have engaged in a secretive but much talked-about venture to make old dogs new. They have conducted gene therapy on beagles with the Tufts veterinary school, and are currently advertising for Cavalier King Charles spaniels, which are highly prone to an incurable age-related heart condition, mitral-valve disease; almost all of them develop it by the age of ten. Using a genetically modified virus, Church and Davidsohn’s team will insert a piece of DNA into a dog’s liver cells and get them to produce a protein meant to stop the heart disease from progressing. But the team has larger ambitions. It has been identifying other targets for gene-based interventions, studying a database of aging-related genes: genes that are overexpressed or underexpressed—that make too much or too little of a particular protein—as we grow old. In the CD replay of life, these are the notes that get muffled or amplified, and Davidsohn and Church want to restore them to their proper volume.</p><p>Many problems cling to this work, not least that there are surprisingly few “bio-markers” of increased longevity. One researcher makes a comparison with cancer research: we know a patient’s cancer has been successfully treated when the cancer cells go away, but how do you know if you’ve made people live longer except by waiting decades and seeing when they die? Ideally, we’d find something that could be measured in a blood test, say, and was reliably correlated with someone’s life span.</p><p>Church is optimistic about the genetic-engineering approach. “We know it can work,” he says, “because we’ve already had success reprogramming embryonic stem cells: you <em class="">can</em> take a really old cell and turn that back into a young cell. We’re doing it now. Most of the work was done in mice, where we’ve extended the life of mice by a factor of two. It isn’t seen as impressive, because it’s mice, but now we’re working on dogs. There are about nine different pathways that we’ve identified for cell rejuvenation, one of which eliminates<span data-page="page_5"></span> senescent cells”—moldering cells that have stopped dividing and tend to spark inflammation, serving as a perpetual irritant to their neighbors.</p><p>“We’re already in clinical trials with dogs,” Church says. “If all goes well, we should have that accomplished within two years, and be overlapping that with human clinical trials within the next five years. My guess is that dog trials will go well. Based on the mouse trials, we’re hoping that the effects are general and independent of species—we’re using the same gene therapy in mice and dogs and humans.”</p><p>Church is aware that the Food and Drug Administration, among other regulatory bodies, may not be crazy about weird new therapies that address what we customarily take to be a natural process. “Our emphasis is on reversal rather than longevity, in part because it’s easier to get permission from the F.D.A. for reversal of diseases than for prolongation of life,” he says. “Longevity isn’t our aim—we’re just aiming at the reversal of age-related diseases.” Noah Davidsohn enthusiastically seconds this: “We want to make people live better, not necessarily longer, though obviously longer is part of better.” But Church makes it plain that these are adjoining concerns. “How old can people grow?” he says. “Well, if our approach is truly effective, there is no upper limit. But our goal isn’t eternal life. The goal is youthful wellness rather than an extended long period of age-related decline. You know, one of the striking things is that many super-centenarians”—people who live productively past a hundred years—“live a youthful life, and then they die very quickly. They’re here, living well, and then they’re not. It’s not a bad picture.”</p><p>There are many skeptics among scientists who wonder how much, or how soon, this kind of work will really affect aging. Church gets shares for serving on the advisory board of Elysium Health, which markets an anti-aging supplement called Basis, and though the literature is careful to say that, “rather than endorsing a specific product, this network of scientists, clinicians and health professionals advises the Elysium team on product identification and development,” how one distinguishes between advising on the product and endorsing the product seems to many a bit mystical. Others may recall the enthusiasm, in the early twentieth century, for implanting monkey glands in people, a procedure that was held out as a scientific solution to the problem of aging. (W. B. Yeats had a related procedure.) The fountain of youth is always splashing away somewhere.</p><p>Behind the optimistic promise of heading off aging in spaniels and, soon, in their owners lies a sadder reality: that even foundational research cannot always cure a fundamental problem. Despite what had seemed to be groundbreaking discoveries in the basic genetics and pathology of dementia, no cure or even promising treatment for senility, as it once was called, is in sight. Increasing numbers of people enter old age not merely reduced but ravaged by Alzheimer’s or another form of dementia, now epidemic in the richer countries that have greater life expectancies. Old Lear’s primary fear is not of age but of madness, which he imagines precisely as dementia: as the loss of mental control, of memory, and of cognition, seeing his fate mirrored in that of Poor Tom, the ranting homeless man impersonated by Edgar.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>To pass from the Harvard rejuvenators to the laboratory of Patrick Hof, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in Manhattan, is to sober up a little. Here, there is talk not of imminent innovation but of discouragingly minute work proceeding on many slow-moving fronts over decades. Where the Harvard crowd see quick fixes in the near future, Hof, an expert on the neuronal underpinnings of aging and Alzheimer’s, sees the exposure of ever more confounding complexity.</p><p>His tenth-floor office is filled with reproductions of Blake illuminations and Whistler portraits, while photographs of his children cycle on the screen saver behind him, blended with images of whales and dolphins, a particular interest of his. His nearby lab is an open space with small chapels off it, in which researchers—postdocs, junior faculty, skilled technicians—study the youthful and aged brains of many kinds of animals, with what looks like every kind of microscope: smaller viewing ones, mid-sized high-resolution ones, and a single massive electron-scanning microscope that lets his researchers see neural structure down to a dendrite’s tiny terminal spines.</p><div class="Callout__inset-left___2rZjf" data-type="callout" data-callout="inset-left"><div class="CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM "><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW " href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a22707"><figure class="Figure__figure___U_9Te  "><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholder-buttress"></div><div class="placeholder-content"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5cd47cac84305f1e3d7d082f/master/w_280,c_limit/190520_a22707.jpg, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5cd47cac84305f1e3d7d082f/master/w_560,c_limit/190520_a22707.jpg 2x"/><source srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5cd47cac84305f1e3d7d082f/master/w_727,c_limit/190520_a22707.jpg, https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5cd47cac84305f1e3d7d082f/master/w_1454,c_limit/190520_a22707.jpg 2x"/><img alt="" src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5cd47cac84305f1e3d7d082f/master/w_727,c_limit/190520_a22707.jpg" title=""/></picture></div></div></div></figure></a><div class="CartoonEmbed__socialWrapper___3-ICo"><div class="SocialShare__socialShare___92Ene SocialShare__grey___dItUm CartoonEmbed__socialShare___13L3P"><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__facebook___Jm71k " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa22707&amp;display=popup&amp;ref=plugin"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__twitter___3O6QA " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa22707&amp;text=A%20New%20Yorker%20Cartoon&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa22707"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__email___TlCif " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="socialShare" data-track-location="cartoon" data-source="email" href="mailto:?subject=From%20newyorker.com:%20A%20New%20Yorker%20Cartoon&amp;body=%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa22707"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__shop___1TDi0 " rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" data-track-type="shop" data-track-location="cartoon-shop" href="https://condenaststore.com/conde-nast-brand/cartoonbank"></a></div></div></div></div><p>“My career started at the beginning of digital microscopy,” Hof says. He is white-haired, with the soft accent of his native Switzerland. “Now we can collect terabytes of data—we can collect entire networks of neurons within a single animal brain. We do tissue staining, taking a piece of brain or an entire brain—slicing them into very thin sections, which we incubate with an antibody that labels a specific population of neurons, and we collect that. Or we can load neurons with a fluorescent dye—inject it, using a very thin glass pipette that runs right into the neuron—so then we have a fluorescent neuron!”</p><p>Hof’s laboratory is full of brains. In a large common lab outside the microscopy rooms, there are shelves holding rows of what look like hinged, dark-wooden cigar boxes. “These are all brains,” Hof says casually. He takes a box down and opens it; inside, there’s a slide with what looks like a small profile of a brain on it. “That’s a human brain. It’s a section,<span data-page="page_6"></span> sliced like bread. It looks small, because it was incubated in a chemical process—we started with the entire hemisphere and then incubated it in an alcoholic treatment, and it shrinks by two-thirds. Then you stain it, and there you go.” The brain sections are kept indefinitely, Hof explains, and loaned out, like library books, from lab to lab.</p><p>Hof, who has taken to studying the brains of whales and dolphins, likes to bring visitors to an open, chilled “brain room,” a sort of rare-book collection of brains, to see a few beautiful instances. The brain room is a revelation. Here they are: human brains, monkey brains, dolphin brains—the space between brain and mind never seems so large as it does when you actually see the material of mind, curved and segmented, as ugly as an intestine, floating in a fixing solution.</p><p>The room even contains a sperm-whale brain—“the largest brain known to the planet,” Hof says. (It looks beautifully broad, with nobly large-spaced convolutions.) Finding the brains of senile cetaceans is hard, he says. “The ones that beach are young adults, and the seniors tend to die quietly at sea.” Hof hopes that insight might be found in studying neurodegeneration in the cetaceans’ more expansive, differently structured cortexes.</p><p>The study of Alzheimer’s became Hof’s special preoccupation because of its insidious destruction of normal minds and normal character. “You can’t tell any difference, even under extreme magnification, between an aging non-demented brain and a younger human one,” he says. “You have to have really fine levels of resolution to see any loss in neural organization just through aging without illness. But, holding an Alzheimer’s brain in your hand, you can see the atrophy.”</p><p>Three decades ago, Hof explains, research in Alzheimer’s linked two key proteins with the terrible dissolution of selves: beta-amyloid, which formed plaques between neurons; and tau, which formed tangled fibrils within neurons. The relative importance of the two was disputed, but many scientists concluded that those plaques and fibrils clog the brain as coffee grounds clog a drain. It seemed likely that there would be therapeutic benefits if they could be cleared away. “Now, we know that these are really downstream effects,” Hof says. “What’s happening upstream to cause them is much, much more complicated.”</p><p>With the causes unclear—debate continues over which anomalies are better seen as culprits or as bystanders—and the cure evidently far away, Hof can only enumerate the “co-morbidities” for Alzheimer’s, the conditions that correlate most strongly with its onset. They are the old-fashioned sins: obesity, a lack of exercise, bad diet—and the diabetes that these can produce. For all the cascades of research into longevity, the new science often seems to distill into old wisdom: be fit, stay thin, and you will look and feel younger longer.</p><p>“The disease is diverse and heterogeneous enough that treatment and prevention will have to move on several fronts,” Hof says. “First, just promoting healthy aging, what can you do and what can you avoid? Every elder is unique, and will have had life experiences and habits that are unique. So we’re going to have to look at that aspect, in ways that prevent or treat, to a degree, the development of something worse. Then we need to have a better understanding of the causative factors. There are leads that point to a number of interesting markers. There are proteins that play cellular roles that effect a cascade of reaction inside the cells, but it becomes very difficult to target specifically without altering other functions. None of it is easy.”</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>As you take off the <em class="small">agnes</em> suit—piece by piece; the boots and then the wrist weights and the impeding gloves—the feeling is disconcerting. It’s the return of flow, the feeling of choice and possibility as you begin to move again through the world, that makes you recall that what it is to be young is not to be in a state of ecstasy but merely to be unimpeded, to be in the world without having undue consciousness of your own muscle and bone within it. It’s the same thing we experience when we remove a splinter from our foot; what we get is not happiness in a positive sense but a return to not having to think about the prison and the fact of our flesh. We forget our insides, and fold ourselves back out.</p><p>The true condition of youth is the physical ability to forget ourselves. A friend who is still creative in his eighties points out what he calls the geriatric possessive: people past eighty, he says, are expected to say, “I’m going to take my bath,” “I’m going to take my walk.” We can counterpoise that to the pediatric possessive: “You’re going to take your bath,” “It’s time for your nap.” Only in midlife do we feel secure enough to enumerate actions as existing individually outside our possession of them: “I’m going to take a bath,” “I’m going to take a nap.” A bath and a nap exist, briefly, outside our possession of them—they’re just around for the taking, we suppose, and always will be.</p><p>Glenda Jackson, now playing Lear <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/15/sam-golds-self-serving-vision-of-king-lear">on Broadway</a> at the age of eighty-three, captures the indomitable egotism of the aged. Watching her onstage, we are asked to recognize not just the anger but also, eventually, the wisdom of age. The old, Shakespeare says, can become, or assist us to<span data-page="page_final"></span> become, God’s spies. A decade and a half ago, a Presidential council chaired by the bioethicist Leon Kass produced a report raising questions about research into extended longevity. “Might we be cheating ourselves,” the report asked, “by departing from the contour and constraint of natural life (our frailty and finitude) which serve as a lens for a larger vision that might give all of life coherence and sustaining significance?” We do turn, after all, to the imagery of the old for comfort; we turn to work marked by the frailties of aging for consolation and enlightenment. Matisse, his hands crippled by arthritis, picks up scissors and painted paper and finds a new world of purity; de Kooning, on the edge of Alzheimer’s, paints some of his greatest pictures just as renewed simplicity breaks the hand of excessive excellence.</p><p>Swift, in “<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0393957241/?tag=thneyo0f-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gulliver’s Travels</a>,” invented the race of the Struldbrugs in order to imagine what eternal life would be like. Eerily, they were given a precise phenotypic marker, a blemish above the left eyebrow, and were given, too, the ill temper associated with age. Promised eternal life, they were cursed with ever-progressing aging, and were the most miserable people alive. What we want—Swift’s point—is not eternal life but eternal youth, and what the new science seems to promise us is more like permanent middle age. We may indeed already be converging as a population—irascible millennials who feel dated at twenty-five and determinedly upbeat boomers who insist on feeling young at seventy—on a single American age, a kind of shared perpetual middleness, where we will dye our hair and take our pills and suddenly collapse in the midst of the dance. Right now, we live well, and then we don’t live well, and then we die. The most that science seems to offer us is this: We’ll live well, and then we’ll die.</p><p>In the past, as science and medicine annihilated old curses, we worried about losing the corresponding compensating benefits. And yet pain in childbirth, which some thought to be foundational to what we call Judeo-Christian morals, could be largely subdued without any loss to mother love; consumption was cured without lessening the romance of romantic poetry. Perhaps the loss of aging will be one more in that series, where, like all the other super-centenarians, we will dance and make love and ski, sharp-eyed, right to the edge of the still inevitable cliff. In the word cloud of concepts associated with aging that hangs in the AgeLab, the word “death” appears only in a tiny balloon, associated with the stray and bubbling thoughts of younger men—much smaller than the other words, lost among larger clouds of hope. ♦</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ"><span class="ArticleDisclaimer__articleDisclaimer___2kCNX">This article appears in the print edition of the <a href=/magazine/2019/05/20>May 20, 2019</a>, issue, with the headline “Younger Longer.”</span><div class="ArticleContributors__bio___3XQjk"><div class="ArticleContributors__contributorWrapper___1CrIJ"><div class="Avatar__avatar___1_uRc ArticleContributors__bioAvatar___11Nu0"><a class="Link__link___3dWao  " href="/contributors/adam-gopnik"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b742179605b11ad8f0c/1:1/w_130,c_limit/gopnik-adam.png, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b742179605b11ad8f0c/1:1/w_260,c_limit/gopnik-adam.png 2x"/><img alt="" src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b742179605b11ad8f0c/1:1/w_130,c_limit/gopnik-adam.png" title=""/></picture></div></a></div><ul class="ArticleContributors__contributorBios___3_jrJ false"><li><p class="ArticleContributors__contributorBioText___3m1QB">Adam Gopnik, a staff writer, has been contributing to The New Yorker since 1986.

like bankruptcy in Hemingway’s description, happens two ways, slowly and then all at once. The slow way is the familiar one: decades pass with little sense of internal change, middle age arrives with only a slight slowing down—a name lost, a lumbar ache, a sprinkling of white hairs and eye wrinkles. The fast way happens as a series of lurches: eyes occlude, hearing dwindles, a hand trembles where it hadn’t, a hip breaks—the usually hale and hearty doctor’s murmur in the yearly checkup, ",["em","There are some signs here that concern me"],"."],["p","To get a sense of what it would be like to have the slow process become the fast process, you can go to the AgeLab, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, and put on ",["em",{"class":"small"},"agnes"]," (for Age Gain Now Empathy System). ",["em",{"class":"small"},"agnes"],", or the “sudden aging” suit, as Joseph Coughlin, the founder and director of the AgeLab describes it, includes yellow glasses, which convey a sense of the yellowing of the ocular lens that comes with age; a boxer’s neck harness, which mimics the diminished mobility of the cervical spine; bands around the elbows, wrists, and knees to simulate stiffness; boots with foam padding to produce a loss of tactile feedback; and special gloves to “reduce tactile acuity while adding resistance to finger movements.”"],["p","Slowly pulling on the aging suit and then standing up—it looks a bit like one of the spacesuits that the Russian cosmonauts wore—you’re at first conscious merely of a little extra weight, a little loss of feeling, a small encumbrance or two at the extremities. Soon, though, it’s actively infuriating. The suit bends you. It slows you. You come to realize what makes it a powerful instrument of emotional empathy: every small task becomes effortful. “Reach up to the top shelf and pick up that mug,” Coughlin orders, and doing so requires more attention than you expected. You reach for the mug instead of just getting it. Your emotional cast, as focussed task piles on focussed task, becomes one of annoyance; you acquire the same set-mouthed, unhappy, watchful look you see on certain elderly people on the subway. The concentration that each act requires disrupts the flow of life, which you suddenly become aware is the happiness of life, the ceaseless flow of simple action and responses, choices all made simultaneously and mostly without effort. Happiness is absorption, and absorption is the opposite of willful attention."],["p","The annoyance, after a half hour or so in the suit, tips over into anger: ",["em","Damn, what’s wrong with the world"],"? (Never: What’s wrong with me?) The suit makes us aware not so much of the physical difficulties of old age, which can be manageable, but of the mental state disconcertingly associated with it—the price of age being perpetual aggravation.

You become enraged at your youngest daughter’s reticence because you have had to struggle to unroll the map of your kingdom."],["p","The AgeLab is designed to alleviate this progression. It exists to encourage and incubate new technologies and products and services for an ever-larger market of aging people. (“Every eight seconds, a baby boomer turns seventy-three,” Coughlin observes.) Coughlin, who is in his late fifties, is the image of an old-fashioned American engineer-entrepreneur; he is bald in the old-fashioned, tonsured, Thurber-husband way, wears a bow tie and heavy red-framed glasses, and, walking a visitor through the lab, suggests a cross between Mr. Peabody and Q, from the Bond films, showing you the latest gadgets. His talk is crisply aphoristic and irrigated with an easy flow of statistics: each proposition has its instantly associated number."],["p","“Where science is ambiguous, politics begins,” he says. “In the designation of some states, an older driver is fifty, in some eighty—we don’t even know what an older driver is. That ambiguity is an itch I wanted to scratch. Over the past century, we’ve created the greatest gift in the history of humanity—thirty extra years of life—and we don’t know what to do with it! Now that we’re living longer, how do we plan for what we’re going to do?”"],["p","Having picked the mug up, the suit wearer finds that setting the mug down gently on a nearby table is also a bit of a challenge.

From twenty-one to midlife crisis is eight thousand days. From mid-forties to sixty-five—eight thousand days. Nowadays, if you make it to sixty-five you have a fifty-per-cent chance you’ll make it to eighty-five. Another eight thousand days! That’s no longer a trip to Disney and wait for the grandchildren to visit and die of the virus you get on a cruise. We’re talking about rethinking, redefining one-third of adult life!

There is the driving simulator, specially fitted to track the driver’s eye movements as they flit back and forth from the dashboard to the horizon. (“With its new technologies, like navigation systems, the automotive industry is asking people to change fifty years of driving habits in ten minutes without instruction,” Coughlin says.) There is Paro, a robotic baby seal, from Japan, which bleats and moves its head, and is designed to act as a comfort to aging people, particularly Alzheimer’s patients struggling with the “sundown” moment at day’s end, when confusion and restlessness become acute. (“It’s a seal, rather than a dog or a cat, because people have great experiences with dogs and cats, and even Alzheimer’s patients can spot the eerie non-resemblance,” Coughlin says. “Having no experience of seals, we accept Paro as he is.”) There are mobile robotic nurses made for elderly care, and broad red upholstered chairs made for elderly rears. There are large research displays showing photographs of drivers, their faces embedded with sensors, and the varieties of “Glance Classification” that can, when analyzed, lead to “Crash Avoidance.” (“The ratio between confident decisions and ",["em","correct"]," confident decisions can be a story of life or death on the highway,” Coughlin explains.)

work of the AgeLab is shaped by a paradox. Having been established to engineer and promote new products and services specially designed for the expanding market of the aged, the AgeLab swiftly discovered that engineering and promoting new products and services specially designed for the expanding market of the aged is a good way of going out of business. Old people will not buy anything that reminds them that they are old. They are a market that cannot be marketed to. In effect, to accept help in getting out of the suit is to accept that we’re in the suit for life. We would rather suffer because we’re old than accept that we’re old and suffer less."],["p","This paradox is, well, old. Heinz, back in the nineteen-fifties, tried marketing a line of “Senior Foods” that was, essentially, baby food for old people. It not only failed spectacularly but, as Coughlin puts it, poisoned an entire category. The most perverse of these failures is perhaps that of the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"PERS"],", or personal-emergency-response system, a category of device—best known for the hysterically toned television ad in which an elderly woman calls out, “I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!”—designed as a neck pendant that summons emergency services when pressed. It is simple and effective. “The problem is that no one wants one,” Coughlin says. “The entire penetration in the U.S. of the sixty-five-plus market is less than four per cent. And a German study showed that, when subscribers fell and remained on the floor for longer than five minutes, they failed to use their devices to summon help eighty-three per cent of the time.” In other words, many older people would sooner thrash on the floor in distress than press a button—one that may summon assistance but whose real impact is to admit, ",["em","I am old"],"."],["p","“We buy products not just to do jobs but for what they say about us,” Coughlin summarizes. “Beige or light-blue bracelets or pendants say ‘Old Man Walking.’ ”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5cd47cac3e22812e9dda480d%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225cd47cac3e22812e9dda480d%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5cd47cac3e22812e9dda480d%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5cd47cac3e22812e9dda480d"}]],["p","The AgeLab has rediscovered the eternal truth that identity matters to us far more than utility. The most effective way of comforting the aged, the researchers there find, is through a kind of comical convergence of products designed by and supposedly for impatient millennials, which secretly better suit the needs of irascible boomers. The best hearing aids look the most like earbuds. The most effective ",["em",{"class":"small"},"PERS"]," device is an iPhone or an Apple Watch app."],["p","Such unexpected convergences have happened in the past. Retirement villages came to be centered on golf courses, Coughlin maintains, not because oldsters necessarily like golf but because they like using golf carts. It’s the carts that supply greater mobility in and around the village. The golf comes with them. This process of “exaptation” has now accelerated. TaskRabbit and Uber and Rent the Runway—services that provide immediate help for specific problems—are especially valuable for an aging population."],["p","“The dominant paradigm is that older people don’t want new technology,” Coughlin says. “But take the microwave oven! It couldn’t have been better designed for people who live by themselves. It’s a perfect example of what I call ‘transcendent design’—not made for older people, but ideal for them. We’re doing a lot of work in the on-demand economy, which was made for millennials but is working better for boomers.

So, while the millennials want them for convenience, the boomers want them for care for their parents, or themselves.”"],["p","Coughlin hates what he calls “the narrative,” according to which new tech appeals to newer people: “Startup money goes to youngsters because that’s what startup entrepreneurs are supposed to look like, and the products are designed for kids because that’s what startup products are meant to look like.” In his view—detailed in",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%223%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," his book “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Longevity-Economy-Unlocking-Fastest-Growing-Misunderstood/dp/1610396634/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Longevity+Economy&qid=1557761623&s=books&sr=1-1"},"The Longevity Economy"],"”—the narrative, more than any rational calculation of profit, accounts for the technological gap. “There’s no reason for this enormous prejudice in favor of youthfulness in Silicon Valley and the tech industry,” he says. He also hates the misallocation of resources based on mere myths. “We have a belief that we send out our elderly to institutions. The fact of the matter is that less than ten per cent of the elderly go into nursing homes or assisted living. The senior-housing industry is building inventory meant for seniors, but eighty-seven per cent of retirement-age people want to stay in the same home where they have the three ‘M’s: marriage, mortgage, and memories. The problem is that they can’t. Not when the model is a two-story house with a bedroom and the bathroom upstairs. If we can solve the stairs problem, we won’t need new housing.”"],["p","Coughlin says that having simple answers to two questions can determine whether you’re going to age well in place: “Who’s going to change the light bulb, and how are you going to get an ice-cream cone? Little tasks become sources of high friction. It’s not that you can’t climb the ladder to change the light bulb. But for the first time you are going to have someone yelling at you, ‘You’re going to fall and break your neck!’ That’s the problem of aging we have to tackle, not building more old people’s homes or senior villages.” It’s the failure of industry and engineering to address the actual problems of aging—the problems summed up by the aggravations of the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"agnes"]," suit—that makes Coughlin impatient with scientific speculations about extending life. “We’ve already extended life! What we need is not to put off death a little longer but to write a new narrative of aging as it could be.”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EAging%20has%20no%20point%3B%20it%20is%20the%20infuriating%20absence%20of%20a%20point.%20Having%20reproduced%20ourselves%20externally%2C%20we%20fall%20down%20on%20replicating%20ourselves%20internally.%20The%20processes%20of%20cellular%20replication%20that%20allow%20us%20to%20be%20boats%20rebuilt%20even%20as%20they%20cross%20the%20ocean%20cease%20acting%20efficiently%2C%20because%20they%20have%20no%20evolutionary%20reward%20for%20acting%20efficiently.%20They%20are%20like%20code%20monkeys%20in%20a%20failing%20tech%20business%3A%20they%20can%20mess%20up%20everything%2C%20absent-mindedly%20forget%20to%20code%20for%20the%20color%20of%20our%20hair%20or%20the%20elasticity%20of%20our%20skin%2C%20and%20no%20penalty%20is%20exacted%20for%20the%20failure.%20We%E2%80%99ve%20already%20made%20all%20the%20kids%20we%20are%20going%20to%20make.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThat%2C%20at%20least%2C%20is%20the%20classic%20explanation%20of%20why%20we%20age%2C%20proposed%20by%20the%20British%20Nobel%20laureate%20Peter%20Medawar%2C%20in%20the%20nineteen-fifties.%20Once%20we%20have%20passed%20reproductive%20age%2C%20the%20genes%20can%20get%20sloppy%20about%20copying%2C%20allowing%20mutations%20to%20accumulate%2C%20because%20natural%20selection%20no%20longer%20cares.%20And%20so%20things%20fall%20apart.%20The%20second%20law%20of%20thermodynamics%20gets%20us%20all%20in%20the%20end.%20The%20car%20or%20the%20Cuisinart%20works%20for%20a%20decade%2C%20breaks%20down%2C%20and%20can%E2%80%99t%20be%20fixed%3B%20rust%20never%20sleeps%2C%20and%20we%20do.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAnd%20yet%20some%20trees%20go%20on%20for%20centuries%2C%20collecting%20rings%2C%20growing%20older%20without%20really%20aging.%20Some%20species%E2%80%94though%20those%20are%20often%20hard-to-track%20creatures%2C%20like%20Arctic%20sharks%E2%80%94may%20live%20for%20centuries.%20Even%20if%20aging%20at%20some%20speed%20is%20ultimately%20inevitable%2C%20what%20happens%20when%20we%20age%20is%20far%20from%20self-evident.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIt%20may%20be%20that%20the%20real%20trick%20is%20not%20how%20much%20we%20age%20but%20how%20much%20we%20don%E2%80%99t.%20Human%20beings%20are%20outliers%3A%20we%20live%20much%20longer%20than%20other%20creatures%20of%20our%20size%2C%20defying%20the%20general%20truth%20that%20smaller%20animals%20live%20shorter%20lives%20than%20bigger%20ones.%20(Not%20that%20we%20should%20take%20too%20much%20pride%20in%20our%20defiance%3B%20another%20great%20defier%20is%20the%20naked%20mole%20rat%2C%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20ugliest%20animal%2C%20which%20often%20lives%20for%20absurdly%20long%20periods%20and%20scarcely%20seems%20to%20age%20at%20all%2C%20although%20one%20might%20ask%20how%20anyone%20but%20another%20naked%20mole%20rat%20could%20tell.)%20Those%20extra%20thirty%20years%20of%20life%2C%20though%20won%20by%20advances%20in%20medicine%20and%20public%20health%2C%20are%20winnable%20because%2C%20given%20a%20little%20chance%2C%20we%20just%20go%20on.%20The%20big%20question%20of%20human%20aging%20then%20becomes%20not%20why%20we%20fall%20apart%20but%20why%20nature%20lets%20us%20hold%20together%20for%20so%20long.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EOne%20evolutionary%20rationale%20is%20that%20there%20is%20something%20essential%20to%20human%20groups%2C%20with%20the%20slowly%20unfolding%20infancy%20of%20their%20young%2C%20in%20keeping%20the%20old%20folks%20around%20even%20when%20they%20can%E2%80%99t%20make%20more%20young%20folks.%20Old%20folks%20are%20repositories%20of%20extended%20cultural%20memory%3A%20it%20would%20seem%20to%20be%20advantageous%20to%20have%20a%20few%20senior%20citizens%20around%20who%20know%20what%20to%20do%2C%20so%20to%20speak%2C%20when%20winter%20comes.%20Evolutionary%20biologists%20tend%20to%20doubt%20whether%20nature%20cares%20about%20the%20fitness%20of%20groups%2C%20rather%20than%20the%20fitness%20of%20individuals%2C%20but%20the%20model%20of%20%E2%80%9Ckin%20selection%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94which%20gives%20weight%20to%20the%20fact%20that%20helping%20my%20relatives%20helps%20preserve%20my%20genes%E2%80%94suggests%20that%20there%20might%20be%20evolutionary%20advantages%20in%20having%20grandmothers%20around%20to%20take%20care%20of%20kids%20and%20remember%20where%20the%20fish%20go%20every%20twenty%20years.%20(Then%20again%2C%20people%20who%20do%20have%20grandparents%20around%20to%20remind%20them%20what%20they%E2%80%99re%20doing%20wrong%20would%20probably%20suspect%20that%20killing%20off%20the%20oldsters%20early%20might%20actually%20make%20for%20more%20success%2C%20or%20at%20least%20more%20serenity.)%20People%20might%20not%20have%20a%20death%20sentence%20in%20their%20genes.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","Aging has no point; it is the infuriating absence of a point. Having reproduced ourselves externally, we fall down on replicating ourselves internally. The processes of cellular replication that allow us to be boats rebuilt even as they cross the ocean cease acting efficiently, because they have no evolutionary reward for acting efficiently. They are like code monkeys in a failing tech business: they can mess up everything, absent-mindedly forget to code for the color of our hair or the elasticity of our skin, and no penalty is exacted for the failure. We’ve already made all the kids we are going to make."],["p","That, at least, is the classic explanation of why we age, proposed by the British Nobel laureate Peter Medawar, in the nineteen-fifties. Once we have passed reproductive age, the genes can get sloppy about copying, allowing mutations to accumulate, because natural selection no longer cares. And so things fall apart. The second law of thermodynamics gets us all in the end. The car or the Cuisinart works for a decade, breaks down, and can’t be fixed; rust never sleeps, and we do."],["p","And yet some trees go on for centuries, collecting rings, growing older without really aging. Some species—though those are often hard-to-track creatures, like Arctic sharks—may live for centuries. Even if aging at some speed is ultimately inevitable, what happens when we age is far from self-evident."],["p","It may be that the real trick is not how much we age but how much we don’t. Human beings are outliers: we live much longer than other creatures of our size, defying the general truth that smaller animals live shorter lives than bigger ones. (Not that we should take too much pride in our defiance; another great defier is the naked mole rat, the world’s ugliest animal, which often lives for absurdly long periods and scarcely seems to age at all, although one might ask how anyone but another naked mole rat could tell.) Those extra thirty years of life, though won by advances in medicine and public health, are winnable because, given a little chance, we just go on. The big question of human aging then becomes not why we fall apart but why nature lets us hold together for so long."],["p","One evolutionary rationale is that there is something essential to human groups, with the slowly unfolding infancy of their young, in keeping the old folks around even when they can’t make more young folks. Old folks are repositories of extended cultural memory: it would seem to be advantageous to have a few senior citizens around who know what to do, so to speak, when winter comes. Evolutionary biologists tend to doubt whether nature cares about the fitness of groups, rather than the fitness of individuals, but the model of “kin selection”—which gives weight to the fact that helping my relatives helps preserve my genes—suggests that there might be evolutionary advantages in having grandmothers around to take care of kids and remember where the fish go every twenty years. (Then again, people who do have grandparents around to remind them what they’re doing wrong would probably suspect that killing off the oldsters early might actually make for more success, or at least more serenity.)

To use a metaphor of the Harvard geneticist David Sinclair, the information in each cell is digital and perfectly stored; it’s the “readout,” the active expression of the information, that’s effectively analogue, and subject to occlusion by the equivalent of dirt and scratches on the plastic surface of a CD. Clear those off, he says, and the younger you, still intact in the information layer, jumps out—just as the younger Beatles jump out from a restored and remastered CD. (It would not be the first time in the history of science that the way we think about a phenomenon has been affected by the kinds of man-made models we’re acquainted with. When a telephone switchboard was our most impressive knowledge-bearing mechanism, people thought that the brain was like one; when Xerox copies, growing less legible as generation passed to generation, were familiar to everyone, the image of a cell ceasing to replicate itself effectively in that manner was self-evident.)"],["p","We don’t have to micromanage the repair, the Harvard molecular biologist George Church observes: “If we think epigenetically, we can see that we can make the cells industriously do the repair themselves.” Already a legendary figure for devising genomic-sequencing techniques—it must help that he’s a scientific eminence who has the aura of one, with a grand Darwinian beard and a slow-spoken orotundity—Church gained further attention for his experiments in trying to resurrect extinct species, particularly the woolly mammoth. (One of his standard jokes is that the fifth floor of his lab is off limits to visitors, because that is where the mammoths and the Neanderthals live.) He is also among a group of engineer-entrepreneurs who are trying not to make better products for aging people but to make fewer aging people to sell products to. Perhaps aging is not a condition to be managed but a mistake to be fixed. Sinclair, for one, has successfully extended the life of yeast, and says that he is moving on to human trials. He is an evangelist for the advantages of what he calls “hormesis”—the practice of inducing metabolic stress by short intense exercise or intermittent fasting. “Every day, try to be hungry and out of breath” is his neatly epigenetic epigram."],["p","Anti-aging research, in its “translational,” or applied, form, seems to be proceeding along two main fronts: through “small molecules,” meaning mostly dietary supplements that are intended to rev up the right proteins; and, perhaps more dramatically, through genetic engineering. Typically, genetic engineering involves adding or otherwise manipulating genes in a population of animals, often mice, perhaps by rejiggering a mouse’s genome in embryo and then using it to breed a genetically altered strain. In mice studies, genetic modifications that cause the rodents to make greater amounts of a single protein, sirtuin 6, have resulted in longer life spans (although some scientists think that the intervention merely helped male mice to live as long as female mice)."],["p","Church and Noah Davidsohn, a former postdoc in his lab, have engaged in a secretive but much talked-about venture to make old dogs new. They have conducted gene therapy on beagles with the Tufts veterinary school, and are currently advertising for Cavalier King Charles spaniels, which are highly prone to an incurable age-related heart condition, mitral-valve disease; almost all of them develop it by the age of ten. Using a genetically modified virus, Church and Davidsohn’s team will insert a piece of DNA into a dog’s liver cells and get them to produce a protein meant to stop the heart disease from progressing. But the team has larger ambitions. It has been identifying other targets for gene-based interventions, studying a database of aging-related genes: genes that are overexpressed or underexpressed—that make too much or too little of a particular protein—as we grow old. In the CD replay of life, these are the notes that get muffled or amplified, and Davidsohn and Church want to restore them to their proper volume."],["p","Many problems cling to this work, not least that there are surprisingly few “bio-markers” of increased longevity. One researcher makes a comparison with cancer research: we know a patient’s cancer has been successfully treated when the cancer cells go away, but how do you know if you’ve made people live longer except by waiting decades and seeing when they die? Ideally, we’d find something that could be measured in a blood test, say, and was reliably correlated with someone’s life span."],["p","Church is optimistic about the genetic-engineering approach. “We know it can work,” he says, “because we’ve already had success reprogramming embryonic stem cells: you ",["em","can"]," take a really old cell and turn that back into a young cell. We’re doing it now. Most of the work was done in mice, where we’ve extended the life of mice by a factor of two. It isn’t seen as impressive, because it’s mice, but now we’re working on dogs. There are about nine different pathways that we’ve identified for cell rejuvenation, one of which eliminates",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%225%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," senescent cells”—moldering cells that have stopped dividing and tend to spark inflammation, serving as a perpetual irritant to their neighbors."],["p","“We’re already in clinical trials with dogs,” Church says. “If all goes well, we should have that accomplished within two years, and be overlapping that with human clinical trials within the next five years. My guess is that dog trials will go well. Based on the mouse trials, we’re hoping that the effects are general and independent of species—we’re using the same gene therapy in mice and dogs and humans.”"],["p","Church is aware that the Food and Drug Administration, among other regulatory bodies, may not be crazy about weird new therapies that address what we customarily take to be a natural process. “Our emphasis is on reversal rather than longevity, in part because it’s easier to get permission from the F.D.A. for reversal of diseases than for prolongation of life,” he says. “Longevity isn’t our aim—we’re just aiming at the reversal of age-related diseases.” Noah Davidsohn enthusiastically seconds this: “We want to make people live better, not necessarily longer, though obviously longer is part of better.” But Church makes it plain that these are adjoining concerns. “How old can people grow?” he says. “Well, if our approach is truly effective, there is no upper limit. But our goal isn’t eternal life. The goal is youthful wellness rather than an extended long period of age-related decline. You know, one of the striking things is that many super-centenarians”—people who live productively past a hundred years—“live a youthful life, and then they die very quickly. They’re here, living well, and then they’re not. It’s not a bad picture.”"],["p","There are many skeptics among scientists who wonder how much, or how soon, this kind of work will really affect aging. Church gets shares for serving on the advisory board of Elysium Health, which markets an anti-aging supplement called Basis, and though the literature is careful to say that, “rather than endorsing a specific product, this network of scientists, clinicians and health professionals advises the Elysium team on product identification and development,” how one distinguishes between advising on the product and endorsing the product seems to many a bit mystical. Others may recall the enthusiasm, in the early twentieth century, for implanting monkey glands in people, a procedure that was held out as a scientific solution to the problem of aging. (W. B. Yeats had a related procedure.) The fountain of youth is always splashing away somewhere."],["p","Behind the optimistic promise of heading off aging in spaniels and, soon, in their owners lies a sadder reality: that even foundational research cannot always cure a fundamental problem. Despite what had seemed to be groundbreaking discoveries in the basic genetics and pathology of dementia, no cure or even promising treatment for senility, as it once was called, is in sight. Increasing numbers of people enter old age not merely reduced but ravaged by Alzheimer’s or another form of dementia, now epidemic in the richer countries that have greater life expectancies. Old Lear’s primary fear is not of age but of madness, which he imagines precisely as dementia: as the loss of mental control, of memory, and of cognition, seeing his fate mirrored in that of Poor Tom,

He is white-haired, with the soft accent of his native Switzerland. “Now we can collect terabytes of data—we can collect entire networks of neurons within a single animal brain. We do tissue staining, taking a piece of brain or an entire brain—slicing them into very thin sections, which we incubate with an antibody that labels a specific population of neurons, and we collect that. Or we can load neurons with a fluorescent dye—inject it, using a very thin glass pipette that runs right into the neuron—so then we have a fluorescent neuron!”"],["p","Hof’s laboratory is full of brains. In a large common lab outside the microscopy rooms, there are shelves holding rows of what look like hinged, dark-wooden cigar boxes. “These are all brains,” Hof says casually. He takes a box down and opens it; inside, there’s a slide with what looks like a small profile of a brain on it. “That’s a human brain. It’s a section,",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%226%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," sliced like bread. It looks small, because it was incubated in a chemical process—we started with the entire hemisphere and then incubated it in an alcoholic treatment, and it shrinks by two-thirds. Then you stain it, and there you go.” The brain sections are kept indefinitely, Hof explains, and loaned out, like library books, from lab to lab."],["p","Hof, who has taken to studying the brains of whales and dolphins, likes to bring visitors to an open, chilled “brain room,” a sort of rare-book collection of brains, to see a few beautiful instances. The brain room is a revelation. Here they are: human brains, monkey brains, dolphin brains—the space between brain and mind never seems so large as it does when you actually see the material of mind, curved and segmented, as ugly as an intestine, floating in a fixing solution."],["p","The room even contains a sperm-whale brain—“the largest brain known to the planet,” Hof says. (It looks beautifully broad, with nobly large-spaced convolutions.) Finding the brains of senile cetaceans is hard, he says. “The ones that beach are young adults, and the seniors tend to die quietly at sea.” Hof hopes that insight might be found in studying neurodegeneration in the cetaceans’ more expansive, differently structured cortexes."],["p","The study of Alzheimer’s became Hof’s special preoccupation because of its insidious destruction of normal minds and normal character. “You can’t tell any difference, even under extreme magnification, between an aging non-demented brain and a younger human one,” he says. “You have to have really fine levels of resolution to see any loss in neural organization just through aging without illness. But, holding an Alzheimer’s brain in your hand, you can see the atrophy.”"],["p","Three decades ago, Hof explains, research in Alzheimer’s linked two key proteins with the terrible dissolution of selves: beta-amyloid, which formed plaques between neurons; and tau, which formed tangled fibrils within neurons. The relative importance of the two was disputed, but many scientists concluded that those plaques and fibrils clog the brain as coffee grounds clog a drain. It seemed likely that there would be therapeutic benefits if they could be cleared away. “Now, we know that these are really downstream effects,” Hof says. “What’s happening upstream to cause them is much, much more complicated.”"],["p","With the causes unclear—debate continues over which anomalies are better seen as culprits or as bystanders—and the cure evidently far away, Hof can only enumerate the “co-morbidities” for Alzheimer’s, the conditions that correlate most strongly with its onset. They are the old-fashioned sins: obesity, a lack of exercise, bad diet—and the diabetes that these can produce. For all the cascades of research into longevity, the new science often seems to distill into old wisdom: be fit, stay thin, and you will look and feel younger longer."],["p","“The disease is diverse and heterogeneous enough that treatment and prevention will have to move on several fronts,” Hof says. “First, just promoting healthy aging, what can you do and what can you avoid? Every elder is unique, and will have had life experiences and habits that are unique. So we’re going to have to look at that aspect, in ways that prevent or treat, to a degree, the development of something worse. Then we need to have a better understanding of the causative factors. There are leads that point to a number of interesting markers.

Eerily, they were given a precise phenotypic marker, a blemish above the left eyebrow, and were given, too, the ill temper associated with age. Promised eternal life, they were cursed with ever-progressing aging, and were the most miserable people alive. What we want—Swift’s point—is not eternal life but eternal youth, and what the new science seems to promise us is more like permanent middle age. We may indeed already be converging as a population—irascible millennials who feel dated at twenty-five and determinedly upbeat boomers who insist on feeling young at seventy—on a single American age, a kind of shared perpetual middleness, where we will dye our hair and take our pills and suddenly collapse in the midst of the dance. Right now, we live well, and then we don’t live well, and then we die. The most that science seems to offer us is this: We’ll live well, and then we’ll die."],["p","In the past, as science and medicine annihilated old curses, we worried about losing the corresponding compensating benefits. And yet pain in childbirth, which some thought to be foundational to what we call Judeo-Christian morals, could be largely subdued without any loss to mother love; consumption was cured without lessening the romance of romantic poetry. Perhaps the loss of aging will be one more in that series, where, like all the other super-centenarians, we will dance and make love and ski, sharp-eyed, right to the edge of the still inevitable cliff. In the word cloud of concepts associated with aging that hangs in the AgeLab, the word “death” appears only in a tiny balloon, associated with the stray and bubbling thoughts of younger men—much smaller than the other words, lost among larger clouds of hope. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/20/can-we-live-longer-but-stay-younger","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ca62bfcc72cd92d0560","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1ca62bfcc72cd92d0560","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Aging","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"aging"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Aging","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"aging"},{"id":"5c2e1c8bee7fe02cbd16334f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8bee7fe02cbd16334f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Old

grasp the significance of what the twenty-first-century folksinger Rhiannon Giddens has been attempting, it is necessary to know about another North Carolina musician, Frank Johnson, who was born almost two hundred years before she was. He was the most important African-American musician of the nineteenth century, but he has been almost entirely forgotten. Never mind a Wikipedia page—he does not even earn a footnote in sourcebooks on early black music. And yet, after excavating the records of his career—from old newspapers, diaries, travelogues, memoirs, letters—and after reckoning with the scope of his influence, one struggles to come up with a plausible rival."],["p","There are several possible reasons for Johnson’s astonishing obscurity. One may be that, on the few occasions when late-twentieth-century scholars mentioned him, he was almost always misidentified as a white man, despite the fact that he had dark-brown skin and was born enslaved. It may have been impossible, and forgivably so, for academics to believe that a black man could have achieved the level of fame and success in the antebellum slave-holding South that Johnson had. There was also a doppelgänger for scholars to contend with: in the North, there lived, around the same time, a musician named Francis Johnson, often called Frank, who is remembered as the first black musician to have his original compositions published. Some historians, encountering mentions of the Southern Frank, undoubtedly assumed that they were merely catching the Northern one on some unrecorded tour and turned away."],["p","There is also the racial history of the port city of Wilmington, North Carolina, where Johnson enjoyed his greatest fame. In 1898, a racial massacre in Wilmington, and a subsequent exodus of its black citizens, not only knocked loose the foundations of a rising black middle class but also came close to obliterating the deep cultural memory of what had been among the most important black towns in the country for more than a century. The people who might have remembered Johnson best, not just as a musician but as a man, were themselves violently unremembered."],["p","A final explanation for Johnson’s absence from the historical record may be the most significant. It involves not his reputation but that of the music he played, with which he became literally synonymous—more than one generation of Southerners would refer to popular dance music simply as “old Frank Johnson music.” And yet, in the course of the twentieth century, the cluster of styles in which Johnson specialized––namely, string band, square dance, hoedown––came to be associated with the folk music of the white South and even, by a bizarre warping of American cultural memory, with white racial purity. In the nineteen-twenties, the auto magnate Henry Ford started proselytizing (successfully) for a square-dancing revival precisely because the music that accompanied it was ",["em","not"]," black. Had he known the deeper history of square dancing, he might have fainted."],["p","As a travelling “Negro fiddler,” Johnson epitomized the one musical figure in American history who can truly be called “ur.” Black fiddlers are the trilobites of American musical history. A legal record from the mid-seventeenth century details a dispute between Virginia households competing for the services of an enslaved man who had played the fiddle all night for a party on the Eastern Shore. After that, for more than two hundred years, black fiddlers are everywhere in the written sources. Then, around the start of the twentieth century, they fade, abruptly and almost completely."],["p","Johnson was born in the late eighteenth century, most likely on a plantation owned by a family named Hawkins, in North Carolina, near the Virginia border. Early on, he was recognized as a prodigy who could master almost any instrument, but his specialty was the fiddle—the instrument most desired for dances. His owners started hiring him out for parties and dividing the earnings with him, a common practice. Sometime in the eighteen-thirties or forties, he became free. The only attempt at a biographical treatment of him, an article written around 1900 by the Virginia newspaperman Frank S. Woodson, says that he bought his own freedom “on a credit,” using money that he had made playing music. He then, according to Woodson, purchased the freedom of his wife, a seamstress named Amelia. His former master “threw in the five or six children, all boys, for good measure.” The boys became his band. Johnson and his wife tended to produce talented sons."],["p","What did they sound like? It is a profound frustration, for a person interested in early African-American music, not to be able to hear them. Johnson died ten years before the recording era began, and by then his influence had grown diffuse. But a defining quality of his band’s sound is how much mixing it involved—how many styles and instrumental arrangements. There were brass instruments and wind instruments. Johnson’s sons played horns of all kinds. Frank, Jr., played a snare drum. There was a bass drum. Cymbals. In 1853, a kettledrum was introduced. But there were also the instruments we associate more closely with a “minstrel” band—fiddles and banjos. A fife-and-drum sound is mentioned in a Wilmington ",["em","Daily Journal"]," article published in 1858. Johnson’s band played everything at once, moving across a range of stylistic attacks, all geared for dancing. It seems impossible that its sound would not have approached, at times, proto-jazz."],["p","It is a genuine challenge to describe how prevalent Johnson was, how dominant. According to one source, he had “for half a century ruled with absolute autocracy the aristocratic ball-rooms of the South.” By any calculus, he was one of the first black celebrities in the South. I have never come across an ostensibly “lost” figure who, once you know to look for him, turns out to have left behind such an obvious trail. Johnson went from being hard to find to being impossible to escape. Researching him was like writing a history of baseball and “rediscovering” a hitter named Babe Ruth. His music was so woven into the social life of the South that it would not be an exaggeration to describe it as a kind of ever-present soundtrack. Plantation balls, picnics, barbecues, sporting events, Renaissance-style “tilting” tournaments (they were big for a while), random town ceremonies (think cornerstone-layings), university commencements (for many years, he performed at Chapel Hill, and for at least some years at Wake Forest), state fairs, agricultural fairs, firemen’s balls, military “muster days,” moonlight excursions on trains and boats, extended summer bookings at resort hotels, society weddings, holiday parties (including an annual Christmas party in Wilmington, where his band performed for mixed audiences, “thereby creating a warmer fellowship between the races,” according to the Wilmington ",["em","Star"],"), funeral processions, and political rallies. In 1840, “when the new Capitol building was completed in Raleigh,” according to an item in an 1873 issue of the Hillsboro ",["em","Recorder"],", there were “two successive nights” of dancing, with “the well-known Frank Johnson . . . furnishing the music.” During the Civil War, his band often marched at the head of regiments and was called in to play at recruitment parties. According to a story recounted by Woodson, Johnson accompanied a Confederate brigade into battle, but turned around when the shooting started."],["p","Johnson fell on hard times after the war, and, in the end, according to a 1901 piece written by someone with the initials A.M.W., he “moved about a pathetic figure—a sort of melancholy reminder of departed joys.” His death, in 1871, was reported all over—in Cincinnati, in Chicago. One newspaper in Wilmington described the turnout for his funeral as “the largest, we think, that has ever occurred in this city, it being estimated that there were at least two thousand persons in

One of the few things we know about him is that he mentored, and passed his internal songbook on to, a man named John Arch Thompson, who lived in various rural pockets of the Piedmont: Cedar Grove and Cheeks (both in Orange County) and, finally, in Mebane (pronounced “",["em","meh"],"-bun”), north of Greensboro."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5cd47be1e2959561ac31d0c7%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225cd47be1e2959561ac31d0c7%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5cd47be1e2959561ac31d0c7%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5cd47be1e2959561ac31d0c7"}]],["p","Thompson had a son named Joe, and Thompson’s brother had a son, Odell.

Joe Thompson was an honored guest and a featured performer. Many of the attendees had come expressly to see him. Among the scholars and the players and the scholar-players were three passionate young revivalists, black musicians who had been getting lost in the old stuff. Two of them were multi-instrumentalists: Justin Robinson, from the mill town of Gastonia, North Carolina, had studied the violin since childhood, and Dom Flemons, at the time still living in his native Arizona, had already begun turning himself into an old-fashioned songster. They were walking around and, for the first time, seeing people with faces like theirs who were digging, and making, the kind of music they loved."],["p","The third musician, a twenty-eight-year-old singer from Greensboro, was starting to experiment with stringed instruments.

She had recently graduated from the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, where she focussed on opera, and had only begun wading into the muddier waters of what the cultural critic Greil Marcus calls “the old weird America.” Her background was in youth choir and art song, but, since college, she had become increasingly interested in her home ground. She was picking up new instruments. Thanks to a job as a hostess at a Macaroni Grill, where her duties included singing old Italian arias, she earned enough to buy a ninety-nine-dollar Chinese fiddle and her first banjo, a Deering Goodtime. She had read “African Banjo Echoes in Appalachia,” by Cecelia (Cece) Conway, and was corresponding with the author.

first met Giddens one afternoon in the spring of 2015, in the kitchen of a cozy Greensboro ranch house she’d recently bought. It was the first of many meetings and conversations throughout the past four years, a running discussion about the origins of the music she draws from, a style that she transforms in her playing, and which has been an obsession of mine for twenty-five years. That day, I started by asking her to describe Thompson."],["p","“Joe?” Giddens said, and gave a characteristic sideways glance, drawing in her cheek and seeming to conjure him in her mind. “He always wore a button-up shirt, and dark pants and a hat—always a hat, like a trucker’s hat of some kind.” He was “formal and friendly all at once—very Southern that way.” She’d immediately noticed “how assured he was,” she said. “Like a rock, secure in his place in the world and in his purpose.” His purpose? “To play fiddle,” she said."],["p","Thompson’s father had grown up playing music at “wood choppings” in rural Orange County. When Giddens and Thompson met, at the festival, Giddens mentioned that her grandmother Armintha (Mint) Morrow, who helped raise her, came from Mebane, too. From then on, Giddens said, “I was Miss Morrow.”"],["p","The trio called themselves the Carolina Chocolate Drops. In 2005, they started making trips to Mebane, to sit at Thompson’s feet. The formation of the band was inseparable from these pilgrimages. In playing with Thompson, they were learning to play with one another, and in reading his human songbook they established their own repertoire. Thompson had suffered a stroke in 2001, Giddens said, “but he was still pretty good for a while, and he played till he died.” There were barbecues at his house, and people from the town came, some to join in the playing, most to listen. Giddens watched his hands. Many of the songs he taught her, like “Old Mollie Hare” and “Polly Put the Kettle On,” were those we find in the handful of preserved Frank Johnson playlists."],["p","When I arrived at Giddens’s house, she had been making some sort of healthy broccoli dish for her children, who were passing in and out of the kitchen, followed closely by her husband at the time, Michael Laffan, a gentle, soft-spoken Irish-born piano technician with a quiet wit, who is still her good friend and parenting partner. Their children have thick dark hair, rosy cheeks, and lyrical, hard-to-spell Celtic names: Aoife (pronounced “",["em","ee"],"-fa”) and Caoimhin (“kwi-",["em","veen"],"”)."],["p","I asked what Thompson had been like as a teacher. Would he demonstrate licks?"],["p","“Nah,” she said. “We just played. That’s how it always was with Joe.” There wasn’t a banjo player in the group at that time, and, although Giddens had initially hoped to learn the fiddle from Thompson, she volunteered to play banjo because he didn’t really play without one. “That’s what we ladies do—what needs to be done,” she said. She had learned from Thompson what she called “the feel, the energy, the flow.” “The notes themselves,” she said, “were unimportant. It was, How did he engage with them?” She described his bowing as “magical, something you can’t break down. You just have to absorb. Sometimes I am playing and I hear him come out when I’m not thinking too hard.”"],["p","I asked her to tell me about Greensboro. I have spent a lot of time in the city—my in-laws live there—and its vagueness has always struck me as compelling. Regionally speaking, it does not ",["em","signify"],", even for people who are otherwise somewhat familiar, at a distance, with North Carolina. Charlotte folks sort of know it. Their brains go, “Banks . . . insurance . . . Nascar.” The so-called Triangle of Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill is the cultured part of the state. Wilmington is the beach. Asheville is the mountains. Winston-Salem is cigarettes and the Moravians. What is Greensboro?"],["p","“I don’t know,” Giddens said, with precision. I was prepared to leave it there, but she continued, “It’s such an interesting place. It has a lot to do with who I am. Because of the cultural mix here.” She pointed out that Greensboro has a significant Jewish population, a Baha’i population, universities—including two historically black colleges—and a general Piedmont weirdness that keeps people guessing. “The beginning of the sit-in movement was here”—at the Woolworth’s counter, downtown, now a civil-rights museum. “There’s just a lot of interesting agitation,” she said. “I kind of grew up with all of that around me.”"],["p","Whenever Giddens and I have talked about Greensboro, she has, with a surprising frequency, mentioned the K&W Cafeteria there. She loves it. K&W is a popular regional chain restaurant, a buffet-style eatery, that got started in Winston-Salem, and the one at Friendly Center in Greensboro has been there for more than fifty years. “When you walk into that place, everybody’s there,” she said. “You’ve got your folks off work, you have all of the working class there, white and black, country folk who are in the city, city folk who have been there all the time. It’s my family. Both sides of my family would go to K&W. The food is unpretentious and Southern. It represents Greensboro, blacks and whites together. It’s hard to explain the feeling I get.”"],["p","Giddens’s father, David, who is white, taught music and then worked in computer software for most of his career. “As a teacher, he got all of the hardened kids,” she said, meaning behaviorally challenged students. He met Rhiannon’s mother, Deborah Jamieson, when they were both students at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Theirs was a rare interracial marriage in a city where, cultural diversity aside, the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ku-klux-klan"},"Klan"]," murdered five civil-rights activists in 1979. Rhiannon’s parents divorced when she was a baby, around the time that her mother came out as a lesbian."],["p","The years after the divorce were complicated enough that Giddens spent the first eight years of her life in the country, in Gibsonville, North Carolina, with her maternal grandparents and her older sister, Lalenja. Her grandmother Armintha and grandfather Eugene “grew corn and tomatoes and all sorts of stuff.” Armintha religiously watched “Hee Haw.” Her favorite banjo player was Roy Clark, Giddens said. When Giddens saw Clark one time in the flesh, at the Grand Ole Opry, she “almost freaked out.”"],["p","Giddens talks about her “black granny” and her “white granny.” At one point, her black grandfather and her white grandmother were both working at the Lorillard Tobacco factory in Greensboro. Once, when her white granny needed help with her taxes, she went to Giddens’s black grandfather to get it. But Giddens dismissed the idea that her life was defined by a two-sidedness. “It’s the South, isn’t it?” she said. “The point is that they are different—but the same.”"],["p","When Giddens was eight, she and Lalenja moved back to Greensboro, to live in a house with their mother. Giddens, who was gifted at school, describes her younger self as bookish, withdrawn, not very social or popular. She says that she was a nerd, and the details she offers in support of that leave one unable to argue. “I would make models of video-game characters,” she said. “I used to subscribe to ",["em","Nintendo Power"],". The first issue had Mario 2, and it had all the characters rendered in clay. So I started making all of these characters out of clay.”"],["p","Her family recalls that she sang constantly. When she was three or four years old, she and her father began to make up “little fugues, cadences together—before I knew what a fugue or a cadence was,” Giddens said. In the car, they would listen to Peter, Paul and Mary. She took the harmony she had learned with her father and practiced it with Lalenja. “I was always in harmony with my sister,” she said. The two girls would sign up for talent shows, but their parents would not let them audition with their voices, so they did karate demonstrations instead. “Neither one of us was Brucette Lee,” Giddens said, recalling that, after waiting in line for hours to audition, “we’d do this sad little kata, and be shooed along. We wanted to sing Whitney Houston!” Her father wouldn’t let them take voice lessons until they were sixteen. “He said it could ruin the developing voice—and he was right,” Giddens said. “I’m very grateful.” Implicit in her words was how clearly her parents must have recognized her talent, to have taken these steps to protect it."],["p","Greensboro boasts a first-rate youth choir, which was overseen for more than thirty years by a local music teacher named Ann Doyle. It was with the choir that Giddens had her first public experiences with performing music. “Mrs. Doyle taught me discipline, and how to not breathe with my shoulders, and sit up straight,” she said. Her first solo, a song called “They Said I Can’t Carry a Tune in a Bucket,” was given to her, she realized only later, because “it had all these crazy leaps in it, and I could sing it.”"],["p","Doyle, who recently retired, remembers Giddens as a “rather introverted child”—gifted but not marked for fame in any obvious way. “I had thirty-five to forty kids in my choir,” Doyle told me. What mattered was “that you could sing in tune, and that Mama and Daddy could get you there.” The thing about Giddens that had stood out more conspicuously, she said, was that she had been “way beyond her years developmentally, in her emotional and intellectual persona.” I asked what she meant. “I just thought, There’s something about this child that is unique, her ",["em","perception."],"”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5cd47be18168305a82504aaf%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225cd47be18168305a82504aaf%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5cd47be18168305a82504aaf%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5cd47be18168305a82504aaf"}]],["p","In the cafeteria at Kiser Middle School, Giddens hung out for half the year with the white girls and then for the other half with the black girls. “I didn’t really fit with either group,” she said. “The black girls criticized me because I was a hippie. The white girls didn’t know what to do with me. Then at the end of the year I started hanging out with the guys.” When she moved to the School of Science and Math, “black girls were my friends for the first time as a teen-ager,” she said. “Black-girl nerds.”"],["p","In high school, she became active in a group called Akwe:kon, which was dedicated to Native American culture and, more specifically, to its music and dance. There were Lumbee students at the school, “because of the way they find their students—there are always some from Lumberton,” Giddens said. She herself has Native American heritage (Lumbee, Occaneechi, and Seminole on her mother’s side). She has never tried to claim a tribal affiliation, but she grew up with people calling her Pocahontas. One of her teachers, Joe Liles, “a white dude,” was, she said, “just very supportive of Native American culture. When I go to a powwow, I know what it is. When I hear that drum, I feel very connected.”"],["p","In the summer before her senior year of high school, she started attending choral camp at Governor’s School East, in Laurinburg. “I was fired up,” she recalled. “I was sick of math and science.” Choral camp was where she first heard the songs of Stephen Sondheim. Singing with the group of forty kids, she said, gave her “that feeling of, I had found my

p%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","About a year after the Black Banjo Gathering, the Carolina Chocolate Drops put out their first album, “Dona Got a Ramblin’ Mind.” It had been a long time since something so wonderfully disruptive had happened on the Southern-folk scene. They shook things up by being black, of course, but, more important, by reminding people that the music itself was black—as black as it had ever been white, anyway—and by owning it accordingly. They remind a person of the Pogues, which made a statement about the continued relevance of traditional Irish music just by showing that it could be played by punks. In the early days, the Chocolate Drops played coffeehouses, busking on street corners. They noticed that people were initially drawn to them by the novelty of the sight but would stay for the songs."],["p","Not long after the band’s formation, Giddens had a romantic relationship with Dom Flemons. It lasted less than a year, but their influence on each other as performers was enduring. “I learned from him to loosen up my opera-school thing,” she said. “And I think I tightened him up. He used to stop in the middle of a song to talk.” Flemons favored a more curatorial approach to the music, and was less than excited when Giddens started writing neo-slave songs and narratives. Original tunes were not his thing—he wanted to be a preservationist, almost a reënactor."],["p","In September of 2013, as the band was “going through a transition,” as Giddens delicately described its dissolution, the über-producer and roots aficionado T Bone Burnett invited Giddens to participate in a concert titled “Another Day, Another Time,” at Town Hall in Manhattan. It was meant to be a kind of celebration and exploration of sixties music, put on in conjunction with the Coen brothers’ movie “Inside Llewyn Davis.” (I wrote the liner notes for the film’s soundtrack, which does not include Giddens.) Joan Baez, Patti Smith, Gillian Welch, and Jack White performed, but in the days after the show it seemed that everyone was talking about an unforgettable performance by a woman from North Carolina, who had come onstage in a sleeveless scarlet dress and sung “Waterboy,” an old convict song from Georgia made famous by Odetta. “There ain’t no hammer / That’s on a’-this mountain / That ring like mine, boy, / That ring like mine.” People had probably assumed that they more or less knew what to expect that night—what “folk music” meant. That they would be drinking from the bucket. This was something else. This was the well. After Giddens finished, there was silence, and then a standing ovation. Within a few months, she was in L.A., making her first solo album, “Tomorrow Is My Turn,” for Nonesuch Records, with Burnett at the board."],["p","Giddens’s multicultural background has presented particular challenges of self-definition. She is an artist of color who plays and records what she describes as “black non-black music” for mainly white audiences. It’s interesting to note that, on her first two major solo releases, “Tomorrow Is My Turn” and “Factory Girl” (both from 2015), the strongest cuts were a couple of country songs: a cover of Dolly Parton’s “Don’t Let It Trouble Your Mind” and a wicked original track titled “Moonshiner’s Daughter.” What did that suggest about the future of her career? Was she a female Charley Pride—a black artist who had succeeded at “white” styles?"],["p","A couple of years ago, I had lunch with Giddens in New York, shortly after she had returned from doing a concert for the prisoners at Sing Sing. Telling me about it, she broke down in tears—in part because of the fact that the prison concert was the first time she’d played to a majority-black crowd. “It was so many beautiful brown faces all together, listening to my music, and responding to it in a cultural way I don’t get to experience—talk-back, movement,” she recalled. “They called me Rhi-Rhi.”"],["p","Giddens told me that, on principle, she has no problem performing for mostly white audiences. “Half my family is white, you know?” she said. “But I would like to see more people from my other community at the shows and in the know.” A few years ago, she tried to bring a tour to H.B.C.U.s (historically black colleges and universities), but interest seemed to be lacking. “It’s hard,” she said. “I don’t feel black enough, sometimes, to be bothered with. I know it’s childhood stuff, but it’s hard to shake.” She recently helped to form the band Songs of Our Native Daughters, which comprises four female musicians of color, all of whom play the banjo in the group. When I asked if she had been excited for black people to hear the band’s music and experience it as their own, she responded, with characteristic bluntness, by jumping from hypothetical scenarios to material realities. The band’s record, she said, had been released by Smithsonian Folkways. “It won’t be covered by any black press,” she said. “We took the platform that was offered.” She told me recently that the Apollo Theatre, in Harlem, had turned down the Native Daughters’ offer to play a show. The reasons were unclear, but, Giddens said, rejections like that make her wonder, “Am I truly that out of the black cultural Zeitgeist, or are the gatekeepers just that narrow-minded?”"],["p","The prospect of gaining a wider, and blacker, audience is, one imagines, always an option for Giddens, who could, if she really wanted to, cut a pop record and presumably ascend to a higher sales bracket. But she has been unwilling to compromise her quest, which is, in part, to remind people that the music she plays ",["em","is"]," black music. In 2017, she received a MacArthur “genius” grant, a validation that has reinforced her tendency to stick to her instincts. “You do what you’re given,” she told me on the phone recently. “I’m not gonna force something or fake something to try to get more black people at my shows. I’m not gonna do some big hip-hop crossover.” She paused, and remembered that she is about to do a hip-hop crossover, with her nephew Justin, a.k.a. Demeanor, a rapper who also plays the banjo. “Well,” she said, laughing, “not unless I can find a way to make it authentic.” She told me that she does not really like hip-hop. This threw me into the comical position of trying to sell her on the genre. “The stuff I like is the protest music,” she said. “I like Queen Latifah. But the over-all doesn’t speak to me. I’m not an urban black person. I’m a country black person.”"],["p","A curious case of the cultural static that sometimes buzzes around Giddens’s work is the guest-starring role she played a couple of years ago on the CMT series “Nashville.” The role was undoubtedly good for her career, in that it exposed wide audiences to her music. When I have been walking around with her, a lot of the people who have recognized her have asked not if she was that famous singer of old Southern music but if she was “that girl from ‘Nashville.’ ” Or, actually, more often, they’d say, “Do people tell you you look just like that girl from ‘Nashville’?” I should add that it has mostly been white people who have said these things. She remarked to me recently that, in the mainstream black entertainment community, “nobody gave a shit I was on ‘Nashville.’ ”"],["p","On a rainy evening in 2016, I visited Giddens on the set of the show, in an industrial-looking studio building on a remote road at the edge of Nashville. Earlier in the year, the show, which was originally broadcast on ABC, had been cancelled, but, after an outcry on the Internet, CMT picked it up. The show’s plot centers on the lives of two successful female country singers, played by Connie Britton, of “Friday Night Lights” greatness, and Hayden Panettiere, who is best known for having starred on the show “Heroes.” At the time, Panettiere was engaged to a Ukrainian boxer almost twice her size. They FaceTimed while I was on set, and she held up the phone, saying, “Say hi to Wlad, everybody!” Wlad said nothing."],["p","Giddens’s character on “Nashville” is one of the most perfect examples on film of what ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/spike-lee"},"Spike Lee"]," has called the “magical Negro”—the black character whose role in a white film is to be full of wisdom, to save the white characters’ souls, and then to disappear or cease to matter to the story. Giddens, who is very professionally gracious, never used that term, but, unless she’d recently undergone a temporary reversible lobotomy on the sly, she was aware of the reality. The way her character gets introduced is amazing. Panettiere’s character is in a plane crash. She survives—her seat seems to have popped out of the airplane and landed in a field, and her legs are broken, but she’s alive. Giddens’s character sort of walks up out of the field, through a cold mist. In a cotton dress. I’m telling you, it’s amazing. She squats down by the broken Panettiere and tells her that everything is going to be O.K. She also goes ahead and sings her some things about Jesus—because Giddens’s character is also a preacher of some kind, and deeply spiritual. Just . . . magical as hell."],["p","On set, I got to peek in on a scene in which Giddens and Panettiere were sitting in a restaurant discussing life, and Giddens’s character was laying down major—I mean ",["em","bone"],"-crushing—wisdom across an Applebee’s-style table. I also watched a church scene. That was very interesting. Black church, pews full of African-American faces. Panettiere was standing in front of them, delivering an apology speech. Apparently, she had come to them at some point in the show’s arc to learn about their music but had then gone and used the music in a self-serving way, not really respecting the tradition. Luckily for her, the people in that room had hearts full of magic, so there was a sort of spontaneous group vote or instant decision to forgive her. Followed by choral

few days after I visited Giddens on set, she went to a low-key recording session in the basement of a suburban house in East Nashville that belonged to Chance McCoy, a multi-instrumentalist with the band Old Crow Medicine Show, who was just starting to be known as a songwriter, a film composer, and a producer. McCoy had been hired to create a soundtrack for a short informational film about President Andrew Jackson, which would play on a loop, presumably for years, at the Hermitage, the house where Jackson lived, east of the city. The film included information about Jackson’s life and legacy, about the generations of slaves who lived on the plantation, and about the Cherokee people whom he fought beside in frontier battles and later helped to massacre and displace."],["p","Giddens ate some Chinese food and drank a hard cider. Then she moved to a chair, picked up her old minstrel banjo, and sat quite upright, tuning it. The banjo: an instrument whose origins are so contested—is it African? European? or a “cross-bred instrument,” as one scholar has called it?—that it expresses the messiness of American history before a person has played a note. The record that Giddens had just finished making, in Louisiana, with the musician and producer Dirk Powell, “Freedom Highway,” is built on the sound of the minstrel banjo, which represents a mid-nineteenth-century phase in the instrument’s evolution. It has no frets and is tuned differently. The sound is lower and plunkier. The lyrics of a handful of songs on that record are based on slave-era stories from the South, and this banjo exerted the real presence. “It’s my axe,” Giddens said."],["p","McCoy sat at his computer, recording and letting her riff. The film was running on a screen, and the voice of Jon Meacham, the Tennessee-born editor and biographer of Jackson, among other Presidents, was narrating Jackson’s life in his distinctive drone. Images of the house and the grounds flashed by, pausing for Ken Burns-style zooms and pans. Giddens bowed her head and started to play. She was doing runs on the fretboard, and she was moaning melodically, with them and against them. The job, I suppose, was to create something simultaneously Southern white (i.e., Appalachian), early African-American, and Cherokee. There was no one on the planet more suited to the moment. Giddens strummed, channelling. She could have been sitting in a pub in Cork; on a street corner in Dakar or in Temple, Texas; or by a campfire on the old Southern frontier."],["p","The exercise was also a musical articulation of a set of ideas that Giddens has been developing for the past four or five years. This past September, in the keynote address at the three-day AmericanaFest conference, in London, she told the audience, “Nobody owns an instrument. No culture gets to put the lockdown on anything. Say the word ‘bagpipes,’ and, if you are anything like the me of a few years ago, it conjures up the image of a kilted Highlander and the land of moors and heather—but now I know it should also bring to mind an old man in a doorway in Sicily, the smartly uniformed military band in Iraq, or a modern young woman from Galicia.” She then referred to the thirty-year-old book “Origins of the Popular Style,” by the South African scholar and librarian Peter Van der Merwe. It has become a cult classic. She used it to illustrate her point that the instruments that we typically “think of in modern music—the guitar, the banjo, bagpipes, violins, the list goes on—have been in constant movement and constant change since the time of the ancient world.”"],["p","In the book, Van der Merwe attempts to address why the popular music of the twentieth century sounds the way it does. He notes that many different folk-music traditions tend to contain a particular kind of melody or set of notes, “neutral intervals,” between major and minor. In America, we call them “blue notes”—flatted thirds and sevenths and fifths. They can suggest moaning and dissonance. The cord that binds the various global sub-styles of folk in which these notes occur is what the ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax termed the “Old High Culture” of Eurasia, which stretched back to Mesopotamia. Strangely, perhaps, given that we are talking about twentieth-century popular music, it was often Islamic song traditions that acted as the conveyor for these deep strains in world music. Van der Merwe shows how the “gliding chromaticism” characteristic of the blues spread via Islamic influence into West Africa (in particular the Senegambia region) and, via Spain, into Ireland and the “Celtic fringe.” From those places, these styles and sounds rode farther west, to North America, on slave ships and immigrant ships. In the American South, the Celtic and the African musical traditions met. It was an odd family reunion. Each culture had its own songs, but the idioms understood one another. The result was American music."],["p","The title of Giddens’s newest record, “there is no Other,” released this month, plays on a kind of double entendre between the romantic phrase that it initially calls to mind and the intellectual assertion that it reveals on second reading. To my ears, the album is the first true Rhiannon Giddens record. Joe Henry produced it, beautifully, by getting as far out of the way as possible. The arrangements are stark. The engineering and the mike placement are direct and intimate. It’s the sonic equivalent of a long still shot in natural light."],["p","Giddens’s collaborator on the record, and one of the only other people who plays on it, is the forty-one-year-old Italian multi-instrumentalist Francesco Turrisi, who is now also Giddens’s romantic partner. When I asked how they met, she said, “He saw an article about me in a magazine seven or eight years ago—and, as he has taught the history of jazz as a course, he went, ‘Aha! The missing link—black string-band music.’ ” The cellist Kate Ellis connected them.

He has since become an expert on drums from all over the world—frame drums, mainly, the stem cells of human percussion, of which almost every culture has some version. Ireland’s is the bodhran, and others include the ",["em","tamburello"]," (Italy), the ",["em","bendir"]," (North Africa), the ",["em","pandeiro"]," (Brazil), and the tambourine. There are hundreds, and Turrisi is expert at half of them."],["p","The album that Giddens and Turrisi have made together functions as a kind of proof of Van der Merwe’s musicological thesis. Styles blow through the record like winds through a shack. The blues, Appalachia, American art song, and music from Italy, Africa, Brazil, Scotland, and Ireland. Perhaps the most powerful song on the record is a version of “Little Margaret,” a ballad that can be traced back to fourteenth-century England. The song is a ghost story. A girl named Margaret is combing her hair, sitting “in her high hall chair,” and she sees her lover ride by with another girl, his “new-made bride.” Her heart dies. She throws down her comb and declares that she will visit him one last time, then never again. She appears at the foot of his bed in the night, “all dressed in white.” She asks how he likes his sheets and pillow, how he likes his fair young maid. He answers that he likes them fine, but not as much as he loves her. He realizes that he must have her:"],["blockquote",["p","He called the servant man to go,",["br"],"Saddled the dappled roan,",["br"],"And he rode to her father’s house that night,",["br"],"Knocked on the door alone."],["p","Saying, “Is little Margaret in her room?",["br"],"Or is she in the hall?”",["br"],"“Little Margaret’s in her cold black coffin,",["br"],"With her face turned toward the wall.”"]],["p","The North Carolina balladeer Sheila Kay Adams, whom Giddens calls “a tradition-bearer,” taught her the song at a conference many years ago. “When you hear a good ballad singer, they disappear, and the story lives, and you kind of trance out listening to it,” Giddens said. The American ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax recorded Adams performing the song in 1982. In January of last year, at Turrisi’s apartment in Dublin, Turrisi, who had worked with an Irish singer who sang ",["em","sean-nós"],", unaccompanied ballads, asked Giddens if she knew any. She didn’t, but she knew what she called “American ",["em","sean-nós"],", the Appalachian ballads.” She sang “Little Margaret” for him. “We just put it together,” she said. Turrisi was using the ",["em","daf"],", an Iranian frame drum with metal rings in the back, which is used a lot in Sufi music."],["p","In the album version of the song, the ",["em","daf"]," pounds furiously behind Giddens’s vocals. You can hear the sound of someone running away in the drumming, a tantivy of hooves, death approaching. Little Margaret dies. Her lover kisses her in the coffin, then he dies. It seems doubtful that his new bride lives much longer. The result is an authentically frightening piece of music. It puts me in mind of the song “Jackie,” from Sinéad O’Connor’s first record, about a woman who refuses to believe that her man has died at sea and who walks the beach for the rest of her life, watching for him. “This is the cornerstone of what we do and what we’re doing,” Giddens told me. “Here’s a song from the mountains of America, and here’s a drum from halfway across the world, and they’re speaking the same language.”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EIn%20the%20eighteen-nineties%2C%20a%20new%20political%20movement%20calling%20itself%20the%20Fusion%20Party%E2%80%94a%20multiracial%20group%20made%20up%20of%20white%20populists%20and%20radical%20Republicans%2C%20many%20of%20whom%20were%20black%E2%80%94was%20gaining%20power%20in%20North%20Carolina.%20Although%20much%20of%20the%20state%20was%20controlled%20by%20white%20supremacists%2C%20Wilmington%20had%20become%20a%20stronghold%20of%20Fusionist%20power.%20The%20wharves%20there%20had%20created%20work%20opportunities%20for%20free%20black%20people.%20After%20the%20Civil%20War%2C%20African-Americans%20in%20the%20city%20began%20to%20start%20businesses%2C%20own%20property%2C%20and%20win%20political%20office.%20In%201898%2C%20a%20local%20black%20newspaper%20editor%2C%20Alex%20Manly%2C%20published%20an%20editorial%20arguing%20that%2C%20as%20often%20as%20not%2C%20interracial%20relationships%20in%20the%20South%20were%20consensual.%20Democratic%20editors%20reprinted%20it%20over%20and%20over%2C%20for%20months%2C%20in%20newspapers%20friendly%20to%20the%20white-supremacist%20cause%2C%20deliberately%20fomenting%20a%20readiness%20for%20violent%20action%20among%20a%20large%20part%20of%20the%20state%E2%80%99s%20white%20citizenry.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EOn%20October%2027th%2C%20Alfred%20Moore%20Waddell%2C%20a%20onetime%20Confederate%20colonel%20and%20a%20former%20U.S.%20congressman%2C%20whose%20career%20was%20in%20decline%2C%20gave%20a%20speech%20to%20hundreds%20of%20white%20supremacists%20from%20the%20stage%20at%20Thalian%20Hall%2C%20a%20big%20theatre%20downtown%2C%20advocating%20for%20a%20violent%20takeover.%20He%20declared%20that%20the%20whites%20of%20Wilmington%20would%20%E2%80%9Chave%20no%20more%20of%20the%20intolerable%20conditions%20under%20which%20we%20live%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20that%20they%20were%20%E2%80%9Cresolved%20to%20change%20them%2C%20if%20we%20have%20to%20choke%20the%20current%20of%20the%20Cape%20Fear%20with%20carcasses.%E2%80%9D%20Two%20weeks%20later%2C%20on%20November%2010th%2C%20Waddell%20went%20on%20to%20lead%20the%20takeover%2C%20marching%20at%20the%20front%20of%20a%20white-supremacist%20mob%20with%20a%20rifle%20over%20his%20shoulder.%20An%20unknown%20number%20of%20black%20people%20were%20murdered%20in%20daylight%2C%20and%20the%20progressive%20Republican%20city%20and%20county%20governments%20were%20overthrown.%20Some%20historians%20consider%20it%20the%20only%20successful%20political%20coup%20in%20American%20history.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ECuriously%2C%20Waddell%20was%20%E2%80%9CA.M.W.%2C%E2%80%9D%20who%2C%20as%20the%20reader%20may%20recall%2C%20had%20remembered%20Frank%20Johnson%20in%20the%20musician%E2%80%99s%20decline%20and%20dotage.%20In%20fact%2C%20Waddell%20left%20us%20some%20of%20the%20most%20vivid%20portraits%20of%20Johnson%2C%20having%20seen%20him%20play%20at%20numerous%20balls%20in%20the%20eighteen-fifties.%20The%20fiddler%2C%20Waddell%20recalled%20in%20one%20essay%2C%20%E2%80%9Cusually%20wore%20a%20stovepipe%20hat%2C%20a%20stock%20of%20the%20old%20style%2C%20instead%20of%20a%20cravat%2C%20and%20a%20spike%20tail%20coat%20with%20brass%20buttons.%E2%80%9D%20At%20a%20ball%20one%20night%2C%20while%20Waddell%20and%20a%20pretty%20girl%20were%20dancing%20together%20near%20the%20center%20of%20the%20dance%20floor%2C%20Johnson%20stepped%20down%20from%20the%20stand%20where%20he%20had%20been%20playing%20and%20walked%20up%20beside%20them%20and%20fiddled%20to%20them%2C%20for%20them.%20As%20Waddell%20recalled%2C%20Johnson%2C%20with%20the%20violin%20%E2%80%9Cstill%20under%20his%20chin%2C%E2%80%9D%20cried%20out%2C%20%E2%80%9CThat%E2%80%99s%20the%20thing!%20Please%20God%2C%20it%20reminds%20me%20of%20when%20I%20was%20young.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EOne%20night%20a%20few%20months%20ago%2C%20Giddens%20was%20scheduled%20to%20do%20a%20performance%20in%20Wilmington%2C%20at%20Thalian%20Hall%2C%20to%20commemorate%20the%20hundred-and-twentieth%20anniversary%20of%20the%201898%20race%20massacre%2C%20which%20casts%20a%20perpetual%20shadow%20over%20the%20town.%20The%20night%20before%20the%20show%2C%20Giddens%20flew%20in%20for%20the%20rehearsal%20from%20Ireland%2C%20where%20she%20lives%20much%20of%20the%20time.%20She%20was%20dressed%20in%20a%20windbreaker%20and%20jeans.%20At%20the%20event%2C%20I%20was%20to%20interview%20her%20onstage%2C%20and%20she%20would%20play%20songs%20related%20to%201898.%20%E2%80%9CHot%20Time%20in%20the%20Old%20Town%20Tonight%2C%E2%80%9D%20for%20instance%2C%20had%20been%20a%20hit%20that%20year%2C%20and%20was%20also%20a%20phrase%20trotted%20out%20by%20sarcastic%20white%20newspaper%20reporters%20to%20describe%20the%20killings.%20We%20had%20planned%20to%20do%20an%20informal%20run-through%20in%20my%20kitchen.%20The%20room%20was%20set%20up%20for%20the%20rehearsal%20with%20instruments%20and%20sheet%20music%2C%20notebooks%2C%20laptops%2C%20and%20a%20portable%20piano.%20The%20North%20Carolina%20writer%20Clyde

the eighteen-nineties, a new political movement calling itself the Fusion Party—a multiracial group made up of white populists and radical Republicans, many of whom were black—was gaining power in North Carolina. Although much of the state was controlled by white supremacists, Wilmington had become a stronghold of Fusionist power. The wharves there had created work opportunities for free black people. After the Civil War, African-Americans in the city began to start businesses, own property, and win political office. In 1898, a local black newspaper editor, Alex Manly, published an editorial arguing that, as often as not, interracial relationships in the South were consensual. Democratic editors reprinted it over and over, for months, in newspapers friendly to the white-supremacist cause, deliberately fomenting a readiness for violent action among a large part of the state’s white citizenry."],["p","On October 27th, Alfred Moore Waddell, a onetime Confederate colonel and a former U.S. congressman, whose career was in decline, gave a speech to hundreds of white supremacists from the stage at Thalian Hall, a big theatre downtown, advocating for a violent takeover. He declared that the whites of Wilmington would “have no more of the intolerable conditions under which we live,” and that they were “resolved to change them, if we have to choke the current of the Cape Fear with carcasses.” Two weeks later, on November 10th, Waddell went on to lead the takeover, marching at the front of a white-supremacist mob with a rifle over his shoulder. An unknown number of black people were murdered in daylight, and the progressive Republican city and county governments were overthrown. Some historians consider it the only successful political coup in American history."],["p","Curiously, Waddell was “A.M.W.,” who, as the reader may recall, had remembered Frank Johnson in the musician’s decline and dotage. In fact, Waddell left us some of the most vivid portraits of Johnson, having seen him play at numerous balls in the eighteen-fifties. The fiddler, Waddell recalled in one essay, “usually wore a stovepipe hat, a stock of the old style, instead of a cravat, and a spike tail coat with brass buttons.” At a ball one night, while Waddell and a pretty girl were dancing together near the center of the dance floor, Johnson stepped down from the stand where he had been playing and walked up beside them and fiddled to them, for them. As Waddell recalled, Johnson, with the violin “still under his chin,” cried out, “That’s the thing! Please God, it reminds me of when I was young.”"],["p","One night a few months ago, Giddens was scheduled to do a performance in Wilmington, at Thalian Hall, to commemorate the hundred-and-twentieth anniversary of the 1898 race massacre, which casts a perpetual shadow over the town. The night before the show, Giddens flew in for the rehearsal from Ireland, where she lives much of the time. She was dressed in a windbreaker and jeans. At the event, I was to interview her onstage, and she would play songs related to 1898. “Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight,” for instance, had been a hit that year, and was also a phrase trotted out by sarcastic white newspaper reporters to describe the killings. We had planned to do an informal run-through in my kitchen. The room was set up for the rehearsal with instruments and sheet music, notebooks, laptops, and a portable piano. The North Carolina writer Clyde Edgerton, who happens to be a crack piano player, would be providing accompaniment. Giddens passed on the hard cider, asked for black tea. There was work to be done. Giddens’s tone became quick and matter-of-fact, almost curt—the outward sign of an internal focussing."],["p","In front of her, on the table, lay the original sheet music, yellow and brittle, for a piece published in 1898 and titled “Negro Love Song.” It was written by the Englishman Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, one of the first great black composers of classical music. The piece has never been recorded, so far as I have been able to determine, and seems not to have been performed in a century. Like Frank Johnson, it was effaced by a doppelgänger: another song titled “Negro Love Song,” by another early black composer, Will Marion Cook, became more famous and nudged it out of the popular repertoire. Coleridge-Taylor’s song, however, is often cited by musicologists, who identify it as the first appearance of true blue notes in a piece of surviving sheet music."],["p","The piece has a little-known Wilmington connection. It was composed shortly after Coleridge-Taylor heard the famous Fisk Jubilee Choir perform in London, in 1897. That year, the lead soprano was Carrie Sadgewar, a Wilmington girl and the beloved daughter of a free black family there, who went on to marry Alex Manly, the editor of the Wilmington ",["em","Daily Record"],". After Coleridge-Taylor heard her sing, he wrote “Negro Love Song.” I have owned the sheet music for a long time, and I have often looked in fascination at the notes I knew were blue, but I cannot read music well enough to play it and had never actually heard the piece. Giddens picked up her violin and pulled it to her chin. The music started sobbing out. When she was finished, she immediately began to make fun of her playing, how she wasn’t really up to it, how she couldn’t play beyond first position; she was a folk fiddler, not a real violinist."],["p","The next night, at Thalian Hall, she played it again. Giddens is something of a favorite daughter of North Carolina, and 1898 is an increasingly relevant-seeming topic, as awareness grows that many of the legal roots of the state’s current political dystopia reach back to the violence of that year. The audience was huge, but, as Giddens talked and played, there was throughout the house an unnerving silence. She was sitting in the chair and playing her banjo when, suddenly, she stood up. Edgerton and I were watching her, uncertain. She walked to the front of the stage, away from the mikes. She was playing, picking. She looked up and addressed the crowd. “I just want you to notice this,” she said. “You people in back—can you hear this?” A few people shouted that they could. “The acoustics in this place are amazing,” she said. She explained to the audience that we were in a mid-nineteenth-century theatre, meant to function without amplification. And it did so function. The banjo had carried."],["p","The night ended at the town’s memorial to the victims of 1898. We had all marched there together. People were holding candles. It was cold. A young writer named Griffin Limerick had spent a year compiling the names of the known victims, by scouring sources, collating lists, and crawling around in the cemetery (the one where Frank Johnson was buried). In the end, he’d found eighteen names. We knew that this number represented a mere fraction of the total killed. Giddens stood in front of the crowd and read the names into a microphone. At the end of the list, the word “Unknown” was written over and over. Her plan, she told me later, had been to repeat this word as many times as she could manage—twenty times, thirty—but, in the moment, her voice broke after four or five. Watching her, I was reminded of the time when, in the basement in Nashville, she had been sitting and improvising that music—black, white, Native American, and American—in that she seemed, in some more than figurative way, to have been born for it, for the moment. I think she knew it. ♦"],["p","An earlier version of this article misstated the location of Appalachian State University."]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7d22d4972cd5b83299","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Musicians","parent":[null],"photos":{},"slug":"musicians"},{"id":"5c2e1d9336cecf4019214313","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Blues","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"blues"},{"id":"5c2e1c9ab75f002c8941e4a5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Race","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"race"},{"id":"5c2e1c9941e4c73c088d779c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Folk Music","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"folk-music"},{"id":"5cd2f96cb36101408ccec8d6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Rhiannon Giddens","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"rhiannon-giddens"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"590a18798b51cf59fc42477f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a18798b51cf59fc42477f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Profiles","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"profiles"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Profiles","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"profiles"}]}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Musicians","url":"/tag/musicians"},{"name":"Blues","url":"/tag/blues"},{"name":"Race","url":"/tag/race"},{"name":"Folk Music","url":"/tag/folk-music"},{"name":"Rhiannon Giddens","url":"/tag/rhiannon-giddens"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"John Jeremiah Sullivan","type":"author","title":"John Jeremiah Sullivan is a contributing writer for the Times Magazine and the southern editor of The Paris Review.

artist and scholar Holly Herndon describes the laptop as “the most intimate instrument that we’ve ever seen.” It doesn’t just facilitate the creation of art—it’s a device that connects us to the world, a surface that’s as familiar as our own flesh, a thing that we entrust with our secrets and memories, a machine that we fall asleep cradling. Herndon makes experimental pop music, the result of tinkering and testing, as she chases ideas about the tech-obsessed present. That her experiments occasionally produce songs that are club-friendly can feel like an accident, a bug rather than a feature. In 2015, Herndon released “Platform,” an album that contemplates surveillance by sampling the sounds of everyday life—a refrigerator door, a Skype session. On the track “Home,” an unconventional breakup song, she imagines a relationship with an N.S.A. officer who spies on her through her laptop."],["p","Many of us are resigned to the fact that our realities are made up of relationships—with companies and platforms, devices and accounts—that are conducted on uncertain terms. It’s the kind of thinking that leads people to cover the camera on their computer while passively volunteering for other forms of monitoring. Herndon’s work questions whether our relationship with technology has to traffic in such fear and weariness. She became infatuated with electronic music during a high-school exchange program, when she left Johnson City, Tennessee, for Berlin. She went on to study electronic music at Mills College, and she recently completed her Ph.D. at Stanford University’s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. Her interest in the interplay between computer programs and humans, in a variety of settings, helped make some of her previous albums, such as “Movement” (2012) and “Platform,” amenable to dance floors and seminar classrooms alike."],["p","Herndon’s new album, “",["em",{"class":"small"},"PROTO"],",” is the result of a collaboration with a two-foot-tall gaming PC, which houses an artificial neural network that she designed with her husband, the artist Mat Dryhurst. For the past two years, they have been teaching this “AI baby,” which they named Spawn and refer to using female pronouns, how to use her voice. They trained Spawn by talking and singing to her. Herndon, Dryhurst, and Spawn’s “godfather,” the artist Jules LaPlace, even formed a choir that would perform hymns for her. In time, Spawn began to produce sounds that weren’t built on sampling. We often say that people find their voice; Spawn iterated hers."],["p","Herndon’s singing is full of operatic swells and icy whispers—it’s what marks her music as intimate and human, despite the digital melee around her. On “Platform,” she endeavored to make songs meant to trigger autonomous sensory meridian response, or A.S.M.R., which is usually experienced as a pleasurable, involuntary tingling. She often sounds as if she were trying to breathe with, or subsume herself within, imposing machines, to figure out how they might braid together as one. On “",["em",{"class":"small"},"PROTO"],",” that process is made concrete as she sings with Spawn, whose voice retains an eerie, frayed, metallic quality, something like a swarm of bees. These moments are a jarring contrast to the album’s snippets of the training sessions in which Herndon and her human collaborators sang hymns. The recordings are pretty and timeless, a group of people settling on a shared vibration, and they produce a kind of material effect that Spawn is incapable of. Spawn’s contributions, by contrast, are harsh and weird, aspiring only to absolute newness. One of the album’s most chilling songs is “Godmother,” in which Spawn “sings” a vocal-free track by the Indiana dance-music producer Jlin, whose songs tend to be beautifully skittish. Spawn approximates these turbulent rhythms with moans, nervous chattering, and machine-gun-like tsk-tsks, sounding a bit like someone working through an exorcism."],["p","“We have all kinds of new emotions and new feelings that weren’t even possible before, because of the new ways we’re connected with each other,” Herndon recently told the BBC. “And we need to find new art forms to express that.” This tension has always been at the heart of Herndon’s music; it’s impossible to say whether the big, clubby tunes she sometimes makes are by design or by accident. Some of the best songs on “",["em",{"class":"small"},"PROTO"],"” share this quality. “Eternal” soars and dips like a good dance song, Herndon pushing a triumphant hook while Spawn wails obliviously in the background. You could easily listen to Herndon’s music without understanding how it’s made, and much of it shows a good grasp of what is currently popular—synth lines worm their way through booming, chattering, low-end percussion, providing hits of loud-quiet-loud drama."],["p","But other songs linger in a kind of dense, digital murk—the ether from which Spawn came—and raise some fascinating questions. Do voices make us human? Do we own the sound of our own voice? And, as robot ethicists have begun wondering, is it possible to exploit a machine? Hatsune Miku, a holographic Japanese pop idol, makes hit records in Japan and tours the world, yet she isn’t paid."],["p","Herndon’s music seems to resist moments of ease; in time, this feels like the point. “",["em",{"class":"small"},"PROTO"],"” is at times difficult to listen to, because Spawn is still evolving, learning the expectations of the world. The erratic nature of it all gives the album a disturbingly human feel—it’s challenging and odd.

desire to see technology as neither the best thing ever nor the worst marks her as unusual, given the divisiveness and normalized dread of our times. It feels optimistic to present A.I. as a way of making us feel more human."],["p","The lure of art has always rested in how it captivates us in unexpected ways. The popular fear of algorithms reflects the anxiety that our lives will simply become patterned according to a program—that our autonomy will evaporate as computers tell us what songs we will like, when we need to buy more toilet paper, or what move we should make in a chess game."],["p","In this context, a seeming glitch, like the rise of the Atlanta rapper Lil Nas X, offers delight. Owing to his grasp of streaming algorithms and what makes things go viral, Lil Nas X got his single, “Old Town Road,” atop the country charts, to the chagrin of the genre’s purists. “Old Town Road” is currently one of the most popular songs in the nation, leading some people to wonder how schemes to engineer chart success, based on a knowledge of how to manipulate clunky genre categories, or song length, will affect the sound of pop."],["p","More likely, the future will be shaped by companies like Endel, a startup specializing in “personalized, sound-based, adaptive environments.” In March, Warner Music Group struck a deal with Endel to release albums based on its algorithms, which make mellow mood music that’s supposed to conform to listeners, taking into account everything from their heart rate to the weather and the time of day. Where Spawn’s music is clunky and weird, Endel’s is beautiful, like the pioneering ambient works of Brian Eno. Yet there’s something frightening about the way Endel’s music is meant to affect its listeners—shaping mood or boosting productivity—in such careful, unobtrusive ways."],["p","If we think of “data” as stimuli, or inspiration, and an “algorithm” as a defined process, then the interaction between art and computing can seem less forbidding. Later this month, the French-American jazz pianist Dan Tepfer will release “Natural Machines,” a series of duets with an algorithm. A few years ago, he began playing with a Yamaha piano of the kind that you often see playing itself in hotel lobbies. Tepfer wrote a series of algorithms designed to respond to his improvisations, producing a more dynamic range of sounds than his two hands could make on their own. The resulting compositions are often lovely, in a jaggedly hypnotic way, yet they lack some of the chaos and blemish of human collaboration. They are the sort of thing you might see in a Google commercial."],["p","Tepfer’s work is a modern update of what Eno dubbed “generative music”—compositions that could go on forever, evolving according to a set of predetermined rules. But, as software plays an increasingly central part in our lives, and the notion of “hacking” extends to everything from accumulating credit-card rewards to brewing the perfect cup of coffee, the idea of collaborating with computers has taken on a different feel. In the past few years, something called “algorave” has emerged in Europe. The term, coined by the artist Alex McLean, refers to dance parties with “live coding,” including displays of strings of code being edited in real time."],["p","Much of the music coming out of the algorave world resembles that of Autechre and Aphex Twin, dance-music innovators of the eighties and nineties whose work drew on algorithms and stretched the boundaries of texture and rhythm. A key element of algorave is that it exists largely as live performance, since so much of it involves amateur experimentation. Electronic music of this sort is often difficult to improvise, but one doesn’t need to be an engineer to understand the basic coding commands that distinguish a big drop from a slow, aching one. There’s an almost parodic geekiness to the genre—artists altering lines of code with a flourish, showing their work on a screen. The music rises and falls according to unpredictable rhythms, creating a messy, twitchy symphony of bleeps. And in that intertwining of energies, from a power adapter to moving bodies, there’s something fleeting and new. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7e2bfcc72cd92d0532","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pop Music","parent":[null],"photos":{},"slug":"pop-music"},{"id":"5c2e1c9341e4c73c088d778e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Composers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"composers"},{"id":"5c2e1cdbe56e652c902746f6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sound","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sound"},{"id":"5c2e1c7d22d4972cd5b83299","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Musicians","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"musicians"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"59112013df652b705f4ab93f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59112013df652b705f4ab93f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pop Music","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"pop-music"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Pop Music","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"pop-music"}]}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Pop Music","url":"/tag/pop-music"},{"name":"Composers","url":"/tag/composers"},{"name":"Sound","url":"/tag/sound"},{"name":"Musicians","url":"/tag/musicians"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Hua Hsu","type":"author","title":"Hua Hsu is a staff writer at The New Yorker and the author of “\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0674967909\">A Floating Chinaman: Fantasy and Failure Across the Pacific\u003c/a>.”","email":"","bio":["div",["p","Hua Hsu began contributing to ",["em","The New Yorker"]," in 2014 and became a\nstaff writer in 2017.

She’s comfortable now, after what she calls the “trauma” of her first semester. “I was overwhelmed by everything that the young white students seemed to take in stride, if not for granted,” she said. “The kids all had the same look—leggings, puffy jackets, athletic shoes, and ponytails.” Short-Colomb, who had worked as a chef for twenty-two years, was used to wearing a uniform. “I didn’t know how to dress for college,” she said. “I looked strange walking around in my blue suède pumps.” That day, she had on a sweatshirt, sandals, and ripped, wide-legged jeans."],["p","Last year, her window looked out on the school’s Jesuit cemetery. She would sometimes end her day watching the sun set over it. “I took a perverse pleasure in having survived the struggle of my ancestors,” she said. “I looked out at those Jesuit tombstones and was unapologetically grateful that they are dead and I am alive.” She admitted feeling bitter when she sees the African-American groundskeepers, knowing that the university had built over the former burial sites of slaves. “No brothers weeding and mowing ",["em","their"]," grounds,” she said."],["p","The university isn’t bound by the student referendum to pay reparations, but the board of directors is expected to consider the recommendation in June. If it votes in favor, a reconciliation fee of twenty-seven dollars and twenty cents will be added to each undergraduate’s tuition bill. Short-Colomb helped rally the votes. Standing in a grassy quad, she’d announced, into a megaphone, “The dollar amount, symbolic of the two hundred and seventy-two Jesuit slaves sold, is only one-tenth of one per cent of the average tuition per semester.”"],["p","The result of the student vote is controversial on campus. Some students say that the university should pay its own reparations rather than make students fund them. International students have objected to paying for a crime that they didn’t commit. To the skeptics, Short-Colomb responds, “You came here voluntarily, and you’ll leave with the prestige of a degree from an esteemed university that would not exist but for the enslaved people who built it.”"],["p","Later that day, Short-Colomb cooked a gumbo dinner for her friend Richard Cellini, the founder of the Georgetown Memory Project. Cellini’s venture, which receives no financial support from Georgetown, has identified eight thousand four hundred and twenty-five descendants, more than four thousand of whom are alive. He hopes to locate even more and reunite fifteen hundred families who were separated by the 1838 sale."],["p","Cellini, who describes himself as a “mustard-seed Catholic,” said that he knew very little about slavery or African-American history until a couple of years ago, when students began protesting after a story about the Georgetown slave auction ran in the student paper. “I could not stop thinking about the families ripped apart by that sale whose names had been in the university archives for years,” he said. Ironically, written records exist only because the Jesuits insisted that their slaves be baptized."],["p","“We’ll save your soul while we sell your ass,” Short-Colomb joked."],["p","“History only answers the questions we ask,” Cellini said. “For more than a hundred and fifty years, no one from Georgetown or the Maryland Jesuits ever went looking for the people sold.”"],["p","For Short-Colomb, it comes back to the begats. “Knowing where you come from is the only way to know who you are,” she said. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ed0425c632c6cd70763","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Genealogy","parent":[null],"photos":{},"slug":"genealogy"},{"id":"5c2e1df02bc86f2c9a244b36","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Slaves","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"slaves"},{"id":"5c2e214f81ab3335f580f48f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Georgetown University","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"georgetown-university"},{"id":"5c2e1c9ab75f002c8941e4a5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Race","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"race"},{"id":"5cd4507b8168305a82504a57","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Reparations","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"reparations"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"591bb6481b3bb347bfacdb71","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"591bb6481b3bb347bfacdb71","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Campus","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-campus"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"On Campus","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"on-campus"}]}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Genealogy","url":"/tag/genealogy"},{"name":"Slaves","url":"/tag/slaves"},{"name":"Georgetown University","url":"/tag/georgetown-university"},{"name":"Race","url":"/tag/race"},{"name":"Reparations","url":"/tag/reparations"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Kitty Kelley","type":"author","title":"Kitty Kelley has written seven biographies; her subjects include Nancy Reagan and Oprah Winfrey.

His job was to say it once. Once was often enough—families would unplug a loved one within a few hours. But certain people required extra attention. TV shows he’d heard of (TV shows his own wife watched) had led some to believe that desperate cases were never that desperate, that all you had to do, really, was to keep asking the surgeon, and the surgeon, because you kept him focussed and engaged in the case, would suddenly light up, go to the lab for half a day, find a solution to reverse your loved one’s vegetative state, and hug you warmly at the end of it all."],["p","“But he just looks so peaceful,” the wife of one of his patients told him that night.

The most important part, on the day of, is to relax.”"],["p","The word “relax” made Danielle tense. Lately, everybody seemed to want her to make it a part of her life. Her piano teacher had spent her most recent lesson pressing down on Danielle’s shoulders as she played, urging her to loosen up, drop her shoulders, think of them as goo, or cotton, or rubber (the teacher couldn’t make up his mind), telling her that she’d never play beautifully if she kept her shoulders so stiff, and even though Danielle wanted to play beautifully there had been nothing she could do.

Danielle told her how childish that was."],["p","Danielle never went into the laundry room, which must have factored into Paul’s decision to hang himself there. Anna, when she saw him, didn’t scream. She didn’t believe what she saw, and yet made an instant decision to keep it from her daughter, send her off to school, deal with the situation after that. A cold plan, she realized as she devised it. She was not yet losing her mind. The seconds she was in would repeat themselves forever, haunt her at odd moments, flash through her head in the checkout line, when the girl asked if she wanted the PayDay with her or in the bag, and maybe Anna knew this already, that she’d never be done with the seconds, and so there was no actual need to be fully in them as they slid into the past."],["p","She took Danielle’s sweatshirt out of the dryer, shut the door behind her, and walked back into the kitchen, her heart beating in her ears, her hands cold and clumsy around the embroidered drawings of Chichen Itza. She tried to fold the sweatshirt on the kitchen table, gave up, draped it over a chair instead. She ran hot water on her hands and forearms as if it could stop the wave of cold she felt going through her body—the hands seemed to be the point of entry. Paul’s body was going to be refrigerated, she thought, and Danielle would have to know about that part, eventually—she’d ask questions—but not the suicide, she thought, no, she would never have to find out about that. Anna wanted to go back to the laundry room, make sure she’d seen what she’d seen, but she knew what she’d seen, she even knew that Paul hadn’t pissed or shit himself—there had been no smell, no stain on his pants, no puddle under him.

She went back to the sweatshirt, tried folding it again."],["p","“Hey, don’t fold that, I want to wear it!” Danielle said, and Anna sent her up to her bedroom to get dressed. Before it was time to leave for school, she asked Danielle to make sure to empty her bladder, and Danielle thought it was funny, because Anna usually said “one last piss for the road,” and Danielle made up a song about emptying her bladder while she did so, purple panties at her knees, a song that was also about water in all its different states."],["p","It was getting cold outside, coats had been taken out of storage, time had to be spent sliding them on in the hallway, dangerously close to the laundry-room door."],["p","“Did I tell you why the Egyptians built all the pyramids on the same bank of the Nile?”"],["p","There was no reason for Danielle to open the laundry-room door, but Anna still wondered what she should do if such a thing happened. Should she pretend she was seeing the scene for the first time?"],["p","“Come over here, sweetheart, we’re late. Busy day today.”"],["p","They didn’t think to turn the TV off, or the lights, and the house stayed like that for the fifteen minutes it took Anna to drive Danielle to school and come back, the

Her father had left the lighter on the kitchen counter. He wasn’t supposed to smoke anymore, and Danielle, the first to get up that morning, and the first to see the lighter and the ashtray by the sink, had thought she’d do him a solid—empty the ashtray outside, secure and hide the lighter, give it back to her father while no one was watching, the next time she saw him (at dinner that night, she hoped: she couldn’t wait to let him know that, while he wasn’t suspecting it, she’d been his ally all day). She loved keeping people’s secrets. She assumed that the more she kept the faster she’d grow up.

He’d seen her seeing him, had trusted her not to say anything. He hadn’t even mentioned the possibility of buying her silence, just asked for it with the simplest gesture of a hand.

She found out only days later, after Paul was buried, on one of those evenings when she’d catch herself wishing for another funeral to plan. She didn’t want anyone else to die, of course, but picking a last tie, nice songs to play during the service—it had all kept her from thinking too hard about the meaning of life. Plus, no one (or so she thought) had ever died while planning a funeral. She assumed that funeral planning was akin to hitting a Pause button on any other shitty thing that could happen to you. But now that there was no script left to follow, now that the body was gone, meaning was all there was to ponder. She’d been happy with Paul. He’d managed to make her happy while having only a vague notion of the word himself. Was that noble or stupid? Had she taken too much from him? Would he have enjoyed life more had he not had her to please or pretend for? Why hadn’t he left a note? She knew why he hadn’t left a note. Paul hated repeating himself. The circularity of a depressive frame of mind, combined with the way he talked, a high-speed mumbling, had already forced him to repeat himself more than he could stand. Also: the repetitiveness of life itself."],["p","Since the funeral, she’d been playing the radio real loud, to focus on other people’s thoughts, and it wasn’t until someone on “All Things Considered” mentioned something about the Caribbean that she was reminded of the lottery ticket in her purse. She’d never dreamed of the Caribbean herself, but she assumed that other lottery players had a uniform fantasy of a white yacht anchored there. She played the lottery every week, even though Paul made a good living and she had a job of her own (real estate). When he’d tell her it was a scam, a waste of money, she’d say, ",["em","I need the possibility, however minor, of being surprised"],". She regretted ever having said those words to him."],["p","Twelve thousand dollars. It was roughly what burying Paul had come to. She thought of buying Danielle something nice, like an aboveground pool or a dog, but then she knew it could never be that nice, that it would always be associated with this time in Danielle’s life, her father’s “heart attack.” She slid the winning ticket under a Chicago magnet on the fridge. Chicago—the city she was from, not the band. Someone on the radio was talking about the way birds fucked.

moved out young, but not to go to college. Anna considered selling the house, didn’t, retired early from a sparkless career, took up weaving and pottery, never remarried. Danielle moved back in with her after every breakup, sometimes for a few days, sometimes for weeks. When she broke up with Armand, her mother knew that she would stay longer, Armand having been not only her boyfriend and her roommate but her employer—she left him and her job, as a desk clerk at his hotel, in one fell swoop. Two months into her renewed cohabitation with her mother, Danielle still hadn’t found a new job, and, as far as Anna could tell, she wasn’t looking too hard. She’d taken to journaling, which worried Anna. Wasn’t keeping a diary for depressive people? Were all depressives suicidal? She thought about reading the diary while Danielle was out, but Danielle didn’t go out much, and, when she did, Anna would talk herself out of spying on her daughter’s interiority. It wasn’t as if being aware of Paul’s had ever helped much."],["p","Danielle had thought of suicide a handful of times, of course—who hadn’t—but mainly as a distraction from the boredom of her hotel-lobby work. “If I killed myself right now, in this elevator, what would that do to the business?”—things like that. On many a slow afternoon, she’d wished she hadn’t been born, but that was different. That wasn’t a suicidal thought; it mostly sprung from laziness, or an unfulfillable desire to nap. She was wishing she hadn’t been born, one morning, when her mother came home from the store. She’d been on the couch reading about diluted Buddhism instead of looking for work."],["p","“What are you reading?” her mother asked."],["p","“I don’t know,” Danielle said, and half closed the book to look at its cover. “Something about finding inner peace and pure joy through Buddhism. It was right there on the coffee table.”"],["p","“Oh! That’s my book about inner peace!” Anna said."],["p","“Makes sense.”"],["p","“What does?”"],["p","“Well, it’s not my book about inner peace, and you’re the only other person living here.”"],["p","“Ah,” Anna said. “Got you.” She was silent for a few seconds. “I thought you meant something else. Like it made total sense that I would read about inner peace because I’m such a bore.”"],["p","“I don’t think you’re a bore,” Danielle said. “And Buddhists are pretty good, I think. As far as spiritual people go.”"],["p","“I think so, too,” Anna said. “I’m glad we agree on something.”"],["p","Danielle asked her mother why she was reading about inner peace. Anna wasn’t actually reading about inner peace, she explained—not yet, at least. She’d found the book on the bus a few days earlier and had asked her fellow-riders if it belonged to anyone, but nobody had so much as vaguely looked in her direction to acknowledge that she’d spoken."],["p","“People are just so rude,” she said."],["p","Mother and daughter agreed on that, too, but Danielle didn’t say so. A conversation wasn’t really worth having when you agreed with the other person."],["p","Rude people were a mystery to Danielle, because being polite was just about the easiest thing she could think of. All you had to do was to know when and when not to look at someone, and the distinction between the two circumstances seemed pretty easy to make. Politeness was a quality you could acquire quickly when you felt you were a little lacking in the positive-traits department, Danielle thought, and so whenever she encountered rude people she took it to mean that they believed they had enough virtues as it was, that they didn’t see a need to make the little extra effort."],["p","“Is it interesting?” Anna asked her daughter, of the inner-peace book."],["p","“You could’ve left it where it was.”"],["p","Danielle realized that she’d adopted an annoyed tone of voice, even though her mother, in that moment, didn’t particularly annoy her. She saw Anna getting ready to leave her alone, and understood that when her mother died, no matter how long from now that was, she’d remember this very second of having been dismissive toward her out of sheer habit, and feel horrible about it until she died in turn."],["p","“It’s just that if I were an actual Buddhist,” Danielle said, stopping her mother on her way out of the room, “I would be pissed that people now seem to believe that the Buddha was primarily seeking ",["em","happiness"]," and not ",["em","nonexistence"],".”"],["p","“Happiness is certainly overrated,” Anna said. She knew that that was the kind of thing you had to tell a depressive person so that she wouldn’t feel too alienated from the rest of the world."],["p","“And nonexistence underrated,” Danielle said."],["p","“I don’t think nonexistence ",["em","can"]," be rated,” Anna said. “By definition.”"],["p","“I’m pretty sure it’s under-,” Danielle said."],["p","“Are you all right, honey? You were with Armand a long time, and I get that it’s hard, but you worry me a little these days.”"],["p","“I’m fine, Mom. Definitely not planning on slitting my wrists over Armand’s picture.”"],["p","“Who said anything about slitting wrists?”"],["p","“I was joking,” Danielle said. “Saying ‘nonexistence’ sounded nice, like, if I didn’t exist, I wouldn’t have to look for a stupid job right now, et cetera.”"],["p","“It doesn’t have to be a stupid job, honey. You’re still so very young, you still have time to find something you’re passionate about.”"],["p","Anna regretted using the word “passionate.” There was a lot of pressure in it. She saw Danielle wince. Danielle had been spending a lot of time thinking about lines of work lately, and how people ended up modelling their world view on whatever it was that they did for a living—how mathematicians thought everything was numbers, how writers thought everything was fiction. Even Armand had tried to convince her that checking strangers in and out of identical rooms mattered. “Life is a hotel lobby,” he’d say. She wondered whether garbagemen went around telling people that everything was waste, which would’ve been, to her mind, closer to the truth than anything else she’d heard."],["p","Danielle had never wanted to ",["em","be"]," or ",["em","do"]," anything in particular. She’d always enjoyed learning about things, but the knowledge had never transformed into a calling. Always ahead of the learning curve, she’d ended up taking it full circle, had trapped herself in the circle, even, while her slower, not-as-curious classmates had used the curve as an on-ramp to all kinds of careers. Some of them, like Cesar’s wife, had even invented their own professions. She’d been one of the very first app designers, had come up with a pet-dating app that had made her and Cesar rich."],["p","“Was Dad passionate about his job? I know you weren’t too happy with yours,” Danielle said. She didn’t talk about her father much, but she did ask questions, which Anna always tried to answer as honestly as possible, to make up for the big lie about his death."],["p","“He liked his job, I think, for the most part. The nurses annoyed him, of course, and the patients. . . . He wasn’t crazy about dealing with the families. But he liked fixing people, I think. I don’t know.”"],["p","“Sometimes when you talk about him,” Danielle said, “it sounds like maybe he was a little bit of an asshole.”"],["p","“All I mean is he had doubts, like every sensible human being. No one is always satisfied a hundred per cent of the time.”"],["p","That was putting it diplomatically. Paul hadn’t been satisfied even twenty per cent of the time, not on his wedding day, not when he mended a broken person, not when his research got funded, not even when Danielle was born. Every day, even a good one, was an annoyance or a challenge on the way to eventual fulfillment, which he believed—or at least seemed to believe—he’d receive. The little moments of joy were not for him. He wanted all the joy, all at once, at the end of his life."],["p","“Was he a polite man?” Danielle asked."],["p","“Very,” Anna said. “Very polite.”"],["p","Danielle sneezed and her heart tightened, or so it felt. She pressed the heel of her hand hard and high on her chest, over her left breast, where she believed her heart to be."],["p","“Are you all right, honey?”"],["p","“It’s nothing. I should probably just go see the cardio again, see if that mitral-valve-regurgitation thing has evolved.”"],["p","“He didn’t seem worried about it last time. Didn’t he just say that maybe it would become a problem in, like, twenty years? You probably just pulled a muscle sneezing.”"],["p","“Surely,” Danielle said."],["p","She wasn’t a hypochondriac, but she did have her heart checked more often than she admitted to her mother—as far as she knew, a bad heart was what had killed her father. “Anyway,” she said, after whatever had tightened in her chest loosened a bit. “Jobs. Cesar offered to have me help him and his wife work on their pet-hotel project, with my experience and all.”"],["p","Anna felt guilty about the heart scares, of course—she’d instilled the fear—but it was better that her child worried about a nonexistent genetic condition than about the real one, was how she comforted herself. She knew that some people didn’t consider suicide a genetic condition, but she also knew that there had been five suicides in four generations of Hemingways. What kept her up at night was the question of whether there would’ve been as many had the first one remained a secret."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5cd315eea21d1c027f732bf3%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225cd315eea21d1c027f732bf3%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5cd315eea21d1c027f732bf3%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5cd315eea21d1c027f732bf3"}]],["p","“That’s wonderful!” Anna said. “Pets.

He’d told her she wasn’t too sad, though, for them to remain friends. She’d thought that he was letting her down easy, but he’d meant it. They’d been close all through junior high and high school, had even stayed in touch during Cesar’s college years in Glasgow. He’d gone there to study literature but had become a carpenter somewhere along the way. That’s how he presented it: he’d ",["em","become"]," that, not ",["em","decided"]," to switch career tracks.

Jesus himself never thought in carpentry metaphors.”"],["p","Danielle had a fleeting thought about Egypt, not about pyramids but about something she’d read in the Egyptian Dream Book. Her father had told her about it eighteen years earlier, when she’d been gathering materials for her presentation—how Egyptian sleep temples were also healing temples, hospitals, sort of. They’d looked it up in the encyclopedia. The Dream Book was a long list of dreams that were believed to be either auspicious or bad omens, and they’d gotten a kick out of reading examples, one of which Danielle remembered: ",["em","auspicious—if a man sees himself sawing wood in a dream, it is a sign that his enemies are dead"],". They’d laughed at the dream descriptions, she and her father, because the dreams were so specific, so unlike any dream they themselves had ever had or would ever have (dreams of measuring barley, dreams of slaying hippopotamuses, dreams of seeing yourself in a mirror) that they’d felt protected from the world, from both the good and the bad that could befall them."],["p","It surprised her sometimes how much she remembered from the few days before her father died, as if maybe her brain had known to pay extra attention. It was all the more eerie that everything that had happened in the weeks after was a blur. She knew she’d gone back to school after the funeral, and that she’d gone to the hospital at some point, for the lighter removal, but she had no recollection of these things. She remembered taking the time to borrow the book about sharks that she’d been browsing when the headmaster interrupted her with the news, but she couldn’t recall actually reading it. She’d never returned the book. It was still right there, on her old bedroom shelf."],["p","“Do you remember if I ever gave a presentation on Egypt at school?” she asked Cesar."],["p","She could picture herself researching mummification, and looking up the word “desiccated,” but not standing in front of a room to share her findings."],["p","Cesar said that she had, but maintained that they hadn’t started dating yet, at that time—that the presentation on Egypt was one of the little things that had made him fall for her."],["p","After she hung up with Cesar, she lay in bed and read about sharks. Sharks didn’t build homes, of course. They had to be in constant motion to keep breathing through their gills. Some of them never slept. It was possible for a shark to drown. She thought she would’ve remembered that fact, had she read the book before."],["p","Danielle knew that her mother was lying about her father’s death. She’d never heard of a young person dying peacefully in his sleep, the way her mother said it had happened. Anna insisted the heart attack hadn’t woken him, but that didn’t make any sense to Danielle, who could be woken up by the smell of toast. He had woken and he had suffered. She was convinced of that."],["p","She heard Anna come back and open all the windows on the first floor. Anna was obsessed with air circulation, but also worried about burglary, so she opened and closed windows several times a day. She liked doors to be open, too. In a few minutes, she would knock on Danielle’s bedroom door and share with her some random information about the outside world. This was only ever an excuse to check on her and to “forget” to close the door on her way out. The “forgetting” used to drive Danielle crazy. As a teen-ager, she’d often slam her door in response, but that only had the effect of bringing Anna’s head back between the door and the door frame to ask, “Did you say something, honey?”—after which Danielle would yell at her to close the door once and for all, and Anna would ask why she needed the door to be closed so badly. Danielle never had a satisfying answer to that. She was never doing anything private or embarrassing. Always reading, doing homework, thinking in bed. She sometimes thought now that maybe, if her door had been closed all those years, she would’ve had a more exciting life. Or developed a more interesting personality, at least. Operating as if she could be walked in on at any moment had made her dull. Probably. She thought of the phrase “That ship has sailed” as she heard Anna open the kitchen window downstairs, and wondered if any sailor had ever thought it. The kitchen was right below her bedroom. Many years before, she’d looked out her window and seen her father smoking down there, elbows on the sill. She’d called to him, and he’d looked left and right to see where it had come from. She’d had to say “Up here!” for him to look up. He’d seemed surprised to see his daughter there, in her bedroom, surprised that the interior layout of their house should have direct consequences on the outside world, on whose window looked out on what. He’d looked at her and crossed his lips with his index finger, and Danielle had nodded and pretended to zip her own lips, to assure her father that his secret was safe with her. She thought about this gesture often, how he might have just been asking her to shut up and go to bed, not to keep a secret."],["p","She closed her eyes now, hoping to fall asleep before her mother came up to let her know what was for dinner, or what she’d learned in weaving class. She listened to her heart—not to her metaphorical heart but to the actual murmur, the leaky valve through which blood regurgitated backward at a volume that wasn’t yet cause for concern."],["p","When Anna walked in, Danielle was either sleeping or pretending to. Anna stood on the threshold for a minute, giving her eyes time to get used to the darkness of the room, to discern different gray masses, the bookshelves, the desk, the hamper, to make sure that her daughter’s chest was still rising and falling under the blankets at regular intervals. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5907efd0019dfc3494e9c92f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907efd0019dfc3494e9c92f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Fiction","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fiction"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Fiction","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"fiction"}]}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Camille Bordas","type":"author","title":"Camille Bordas teaches creative writing in the University of Florida’s M.F.A. program.

Wallace Collection, on Manchester Square, in central London, contains art works that were gathered in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by successive Marquesses of Hertford. The museum, occupying a Georgian mansion, opened to the public in 1900, and is particularly known for its fine eighteenth-century French paintings—among them a small and delicate work by Jean-Honoré Fragonard, which is known in English as “The Souvenir.” It shows a young woman carving an initial into a tree trunk. She is wearing a gown of pink satin, its color enhancing the blush of her cheek. At her feet lies a letter that, presumably, was written by the lover whose initial she is inscribing. She looks dreamy yet determined: the woman is caught in a reverie, but she is also making her mark."],["p","Joanna Hogg first saw “The Souvenir” in 1980, when she was twenty years old. She was taken to see it by a man with whom she had a charged acquaintance, which soon developed into a consuming love affair. At the time, she was living in Knightsbridge and working in Soho, as a photographer’s assistant; she aspired to become a filmmaker but didn’t quite know how to go about it. She wasn’t sure what to make of the Fragonard, or why the man wanted to show it to her. Hogg had spent her teen-age years at a boarding school deemed suitable for the less academically inclined daughters of the affluent and titled, and she had not gone to college. Her companion, who had studied art history at Cambridge University and at the Courtauld Institute, in London, struck her as immensely more knowledgeable. Nine years her senior, he was brimming with the confident, ironical charm bestowed by élite English schools. He wore double-breasted pin-striped suits and bow ties, and he had pronounced aesthetic preferences: Symbolist opera, the movies of Powell and Pressburger, a brand of Turkish cigarette with an elliptical shape."],["p","During the next several years, Hogg enrolled at film school while her lover continued introducing her to his tastes and reshaping her sensibilities. He also exposed her to a less elevating aspect of his personality: a ravaging addiction to heroin, of which there was an epidemic in London in the early eighties. The drug came to dominate their relationship, and the relationship came to dominate Hogg’s life."],["p","Hogg, who is now fifty-nine, recently made a movie, “The Souvenir,” about those years; it will be released on May 17th. The character who stands in for Hogg, named Julie, is played by Honor Swinton Byrne, the daughter of ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/tilda-swinton"},"Tilda Swinton"]," (who plays Julie’s mother). Hogg’s lover, named Anthony in the film, is played by Tom Burke. “The Souvenir” is an unsparing depiction of what now would be called codependency but was then simply understood as anguished first love."],["p","The film is obsessively autobiographical. It was shot on an inch-by-inch reconstruction of Hogg’s elegant student digs—a pied-à-terre that her parents kept in Knightsbridge. The set was furnished with objects from Hogg’s youth, including an ornate antique French bed that she and her lover had bought, for a hundred pounds, at auction in 1982. Hogg found old letters and incorporated them into the film. “The vile beast knows itself and miserable he is with it,” Anthony writes to Julie, as Hogg’s lover once wrote to her. “It is you who has power over the beast; to cheer, to encourage, to reprimand, to forgive.” Stretches of dialogue replicate conversations that have been inscribed in Hogg’s memory for decades. Even some of the footage comes from the eighties, when she toted around a Super 8 camera, filming friends and her environs. The production designer of “The Souvenir,” Stéphane Collonge, painstakingly reconstructed the views from the Knightsbridge apartment by digitally combining photographs taken by Hogg. When Julie goes to the window after hearing a nearby explosion—the bombing of Harrods by the I.R.A., in 1983—she looks out on the exact same skyline that Hogg saw when her apartment was shaken by the blast."],["p","The film also offers a moving depiction of Hogg as a would-be artist, delineating the kinds of inhibition that can hinder even a person born to privilege. She began taking notes for “The Souvenir” not long after emerging from the relationship with the man who took her to the Wallace Collection, the traumatic conclusion of which is shown in the movie. (Hogg declines to name the man publicly.) In an entry from 1988, Hogg wrote, “Everyone congratulates her on how well she is coping with it. Ironic because she isn’t ‘coping’ with it at all—she won’t allow herself to.” But Hogg didn’t tell that story, or any story, for years. She didn’t release her first feature film until a decade ago, when she was forty-seven, and “The Souvenir” is only her fourth movie. This summer, Hogg is shooting “The Souvenir: Part II,” a continuation of the story of Julie’s early adulthood. Together, the films will implicitly tell another story: that of a female artist’s belated emergence in middle age, and her discovery that she could create art out of experiences that had once seemed like lost time."],["p","In the short period that Hogg has been making movies, she has established strong visual signatures: she prefers long, often distant takes with a fixed camera, and tends to work with available light. She has become known as a precise and compassionate observer of the British upper middle class, a segment of society that is often either caricatured or glamorized onscreen. Her films have the layered psychology and narrative depth of a nineteenth-century novel; while working on “The Souvenir,” she reread Henry James’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Portrait-Wordsworth-Classics-Henry-James/dp/1853261777"},"The Portrait of a Lady"],".” Hogg’s films examine the world she comes from without embarrassment. “Archipelago” depicts a young man who feels burdened by the expectations of his well-to-do family. “Unrelated” focusses on a group of Britons who go on an extended sojourn to Tuscany. They take in the Palio, shop in Siena’s boutiques, drink Negronis as they lounge by a fifteenth-century villa’s twenty-first-century pool, and play awkward party games that keep the dangerous possibility of real intimacy at bay."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EOne%20morning%20in%20April%2C%20I%20took%20the%20train%20to%20Norfolk%2C%20two%20hours%20northeast%20of%20London%2C%20and%20continued%20on%20to%20a%20former%20Royal%20Air%20Force%20base%20near%20the%20village%20of%20West%20Raynham.%20The%20base%20closed%20in%20the%20mid-nineties%2C%20but%20in%20recent%20years%20it%20has%20found%20a%20second%20life%20as%20a%20business%20park%20and%20an%20occasional%20filming%20location.%20Part%20I%20of%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Souvenir%E2%80%9D%20was%20almost%20entirely%20shot%20there%20in%20the%20summer%20of%202017%2C%20much%20of%20it%20in%20one%20of%20the%20base%E2%80%99s%20vast%20hangars.%20A%20corner%20of%20the%20hangar%20stood%20in%20for%20the%20studio%20where%20Julie%20and%20her%20film-school%20classmates%20work%20on%20their%20projects%3B%20when%20I%20visited%2C%20numbered%20pieces%20of%20%E2%80%9CFlat%20L%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20apartment%20where%20Julie%20lives%2C%20leaned%20against%20the%20hangar%E2%80%99s%20walls%2C%20ready%20to%20be%20reassembled%20for%20Part%20II.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EHogg%20finds%20it%20effective%20to%20isolate%20the%20cast%20and%20crew%20at%20a%20single%20site%20for%20the%20entirety%20of%20a%20shoot.%20%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20about%20containing%20the%20energy%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20told%20me.%20%E2%80%9CUnrelated%E2%80%9D%20(2007)%2C%20Hogg%E2%80%99s%20first%20film%2C%20was%20shot%20in%20a%20villa%20outside%20Siena%20where%20Hogg%20had%20stayed%20a%20few%20years%20earlier%2C%20while%20taking%20a%20painting%20course.%20The%20cast%20lived%20there%20during%20filming%2C%20and%20the%20crew%20stayed%20in%20a%20property%20down%20the%20road.%20The%20same%20method%20was%20adopted%20for%20%E2%80%9CArchipelago%E2%80%9D%20(2010)%2C%20her%20second%20film%2C%20which%20is%20set%20in%20a%20vacation%20home%20in%20the%20Scilly%20Isles%2C%20off%20the%20coast%20of%20Cornwall.%20In%20%E2%80%9CUnrelated%2C%E2%80%9D%20which%20cost%20only%20a%20hundred%20and%20fifty%20thousand%20pounds%20to%20make%2C%20the%20bedrooms%20did%20double%20duty%20as%20sets.%20Hogg%20discovered%20that%20the%20arrangement%20also%20served%20an%20artistic%20purpose%2C%20fruitfully%20blurring%20the%20boundary%20between%20reality%20and%20fiction.%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2Ftom-hiddleston%5C%22%3ETom%20Hiddleston%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20whose%20first%20major%20film%20role%20was%20as%20an%20arrogant%2C%20wounded%20Etonian%20in%20%E2%80%9CUnrelated%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20who%20has%20appeared%20in%20three%20of%20Hogg%E2%80%99s%20films%2C%20told%20me%2C%20%E2%80%9CIf%20you%E2%80%99re%20an%20actor%20and%20your%20character%20decides%20to%20put%20the%20kettle%20on%2C%20if%20it%E2%80%99s%20the%20same%20kettle%20you%E2%80%99ve%20been%20using%20every%20morning%20for%20the%20last%20six%20weeks%2C%20there%E2%80%99s%20something%20about%20the%20way%20you%E2%80%99ll%20do%20it%20which%20will%20be%20very%20natural.%20It%E2%80%99s%20not%20a%20prop%20kettle%E2%80%94it%E2%80%99s%20the%20kettle%20you%20used%20this%20morning%20to%20make%20a%20cup%20of%20coffee.%20The%20actors%20become%20part%20of%20the%20fabric%20of%20the%20scene%2C%20because%20they%E2%80%99re%20living%20it%20all%20the%20time.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EHogg%20drove%20me%20around%20the%20base%20at%20West%20Raynham%20and%20explained%20that%20it%20had%20become%20%E2%80%9Canother%20kind%20of%20island.%E2%80%9D%20The%20cast%20of%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Souvenir%3A%20Part%20II%E2%80%9D%20was%20to%20be%20housed%20in%20nearby%20accommodations.%20The%20actors%E2%80%99%20costumes%20were%20being%20collected%20largely%20from%20local%20thrift%20stores%2C%20although%20the%20costume%20designer%20had%20re-created%20some%20key%20pieces%2C%20such%20as%20Anthony%E2%80%99s%20ankle-length%20navy-blue%20housecoat%E2%80%94instantly%20recognizable%20to%20cognoscenti%20as%20part%20of%20the%20uniform%20of%20Christ%E2%80%99s%20Hospital%20School%2C%20a%20Sussex%20boarding%20school%20founded%20in%201553.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20shoot%20for%20the%20sequel%20was%20to%20begin%20in%20several%20weeks.%20That%20morning%2C%20Hogg%20was%20looking%20for%20a%20stand-in%20for%20the%20office%20of%20a%20therapist%20she%20had%20visited%20in%20her%20mid-twenties%2C%20toward%20the%20end%20of%20her%20relationship%2C%20when%20she%20was%20seeking%20help%20with%20understanding%20her%20life%20and%20work.%20She%20went%20with%20Collonge%20and%20her%20director%20of%20photography%2C%20David%20Raedeker%2C%20to%20survey%20a%20dilapidated%20block%20at%20the%20base%20where%20newly%20arriving%20airmen%20had%20once%20been%20received.%20Hogg%20walked%20down%20a%20dim%2C%20dirty%20corridor.%20%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20nice%2C%20isn%E2%80%99t%20it%3F%E2%80%9D%20she%20said%20to%20Raedeker%2C%20who%20was%20following%20her%2C%20camera%20in%20hand.%20%E2%80%9CI%20remember%20the%20place%20I%20went%20to%20as%20being%20quite%20run-down.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EHogg%2C%20who%20is%20birdlike%20in%20build%2C%20wi

morning in April, I took the train to Norfolk, two hours northeast of London, and continued on to a former Royal Air Force base near the village of West Raynham. The base closed in the mid-nineties, but in recent years it has found a second life as a business park and an occasional filming location. Part I of “The Souvenir” was almost entirely shot there in the summer of 2017, much of it in one of the base’s vast hangars. A corner of the hangar stood in for the studio where Julie and her film-school classmates work on their projects; when I visited, numbered pieces of “Flat L,” the apartment where Julie lives, leaned against the hangar’s walls, ready to be reassembled for Part II."],["p","Hogg finds it effective to isolate the cast and crew at a single site for the entirety of a shoot. “It’s about containing the energy,” she told me. “Unrelated” (2007), Hogg’s first film, was shot in a villa outside Siena where Hogg had stayed a few years earlier, while taking a painting course. The cast lived there during filming, and the crew stayed in a property down the road. The same method was adopted for “Archipelago” (2010), her second film, which is set in a vacation home in the Scilly Isles, off the coast of Cornwall. In “Unrelated,” which cost only a hundred and fifty thousand pounds to make, the bedrooms did double duty as sets. Hogg discovered that the arrangement also served an artistic purpose, fruitfully blurring the boundary between reality and fiction. ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/tom-hiddleston"},"Tom Hiddleston"],", whose first major film role was as an arrogant, wounded Etonian in “Unrelated,” and who has appeared in three of Hogg’s films, told me, “If you’re an actor and your character decides to put the kettle on, if it’s the same kettle you’ve been using every morning for the last six weeks, there’s something about the way you’ll do it which will be very natural. It’s not a prop kettle—it’s the kettle you used this morning to make a cup of coffee. The actors become part of the fabric of the scene, because they’re living it all the time.”"],["p","Hogg drove me around the base at West Raynham and explained that it had become “another kind of island.” The cast of “The Souvenir: Part II” was to be housed in nearby accommodations. The actors’ costumes were being collected largely from local thrift stores, although the costume designer had re-created some key pieces, such as Anthony’s ankle-length navy-blue housecoat—instantly recognizable to cognoscenti as part of the uniform of Christ’s Hospital School, a Sussex boarding school founded in 1553."],["p","The shoot for the sequel was to begin in several weeks. That morning, Hogg was looking for a stand-in for the office of a therapist she had visited in her mid-twenties, toward the end of her relationship, when she was seeking help with understanding her life and work. She went with Collonge and her director of photography, David Raedeker, to survey a dilapidated block at the base where newly arriving airmen had once been received. Hogg walked down a dim, dirty corridor. “It’s nice, isn’t it?” she said to Raedeker, who was following her, camera in hand. “I remember the place I went to as being quite run-down.”"],["p","Hogg, who is birdlike in build, with a thin face and shoulder-length dark hair, entered a room where light streamed through large, partly broken windows. If the room were darkened with blinds, she decided, it could serve as the consulting room. “I think that it’s O.K. that it’s an enclosed little world,” she said. She recalled to Collonge that there had been nothing clinical in the room, and that a couch and upholstered chairs had offered a sense of security to troubled visitors like her. Later, Collonge told me that working with Hogg was unusually intimate. “You still have to do breakdowns and drawings and plans, but it becomes the fusion of my sensibility and hers,” he said. “It’s completely from the inside out, rather than the outside in.”"],["p","The paint on the walls was peeling like fish scales, and the floor, covered in institutional carpet, was littered with dead leaves. The room looked unpromising as a therapist’s office, given that the movie’s low budget would not permit much renovation. But Hogg could vividly envisage the scene, in part because she had amassed extraordinary documentary material that would inform her direction of it: her sessions with the therapist had been recorded, and she had kept a stash of some of these audiocassettes, which captured her younger self discussing her relationship and the projects she aspired to do in film school. As broken glass crunched underfoot, Hogg’s imagination was at work in concert with her memory. “There’s nothing wrong with this carpet,” she said, briskly. “It just needs a good

the mid-eighties, Hogg told me when we first met, she was “very confident, and very unconfident.” We were talking, over tea, in the lobby of a hotel in Shoreditch, a fashionable part of East London. She shares a house in the area with her husband, Nick Turvey, a visual artist; they have lived together since 1990. She went on, “I really had these two sides of me, where I thought I could make groundbreaking cinema, and make a big noise in my filmmaking, but at the same time also not be able to do any of that, and not be even sure who I was as a human being.” Hogg’s manner is wry but reserved. Although she imbues her work with her personal preoccupations, she is uncomfortable talking about herself. “Creatively, I am at my most comfortable when I have got a project, a raison d’être,” she said. “Take that away from me and put me at a dinner party or something—that is really ",["em","not"]," where I want to be.” In a memorable scene in her third film, “Exhibition” (2013), an exploration of the married life of childless artists, the couple endures a suffocating supper with friends who insist on discussing difficulties they are having with their adolescent offspring. The artist wife pretends to faint, in order to engineer an exit. “I always fantasized about doing that,” Hogg told me, adding, “It would be a bit difficult to do it now.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5cd490865b65a32ea26f6076%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225cd490865b65a32ea26f6076%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5cd490865b65a32ea26f6076%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5cd490865b65a32ea26f6076"}]],["p","Hogg grew up thirty miles southeast of London, in Kent, near the town of Tunbridge Wells. The very name is a byword for provincial conservatism. (“Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells” is the imagined signoff of someone who writes outraged letters to the London papers.) Her father, John Hogg, commuted to work in London, where he was the vice-chairman of a large insurance company. Her mother, the former Sarah Noel-Buxton, was descended from a prominent family that included missionaries, abolitionists, and Quakers. Crispin Buxton, who is Hogg’s cousin (and the eighth Baronet of Belfield), was an associate producer on “The Souvenir.” He told me, “There was an energy we all grew up with. It wasn’t always very seemly to be seen to be having too much fun.”"],["p","At eleven, Hogg was sent off to West Heath, a nearby boarding school of only a hundred and thirty girls, some of them members of the grandest families in the country. Lady Diana Spencer, the future Princess of Wales, was in the class below. Hogg, who found the regime inimical, was shy but somewhat rebellious: she was once caught smuggling a copy of ",["em","Playgirl"]," into her dormitory, and the headmistress disciplined her by seating her in her office and asking her to turn every page of the magazine and offer commentary. Tilda Swinton, a family friend whose father had gone to boarding school with Hogg’s father, was a classmate at West Heath. She told me, “We were supposed to be independent from the age of ten, in a way that we clearly weren’t, but we had to fake it.” Buxton said that the school was a milieu in which academic excellence was not even encouraged. “The societal expectations would be: Queen’s Secretarial College, find a good husband, be a dutiful wife,” he said. Swinton told me that when she attended her brother’s graduation from Harrow, an élite boys’ school, the headmaster declared that the boys were the leaders of tomorrow. She went on, “I distinctly remember, the following week our headmistress gave a speech in which she said, ‘You girls are the wives of the leaders of tomorrow.’ ”"],["p","Hogg steered clear of the finishing-school set, finding a small group of peers who, like her, were interested in the visual arts. After graduating, she and a friend moved to Florence, to study photography. “We were very clear, at age seventeen, that we were going to Florence not in a traditional kind of girl-going-to-language-school kind of way,” she said. They found an American woman in her thirties to be their photography teacher. “It was a really amazing thing to be taught how to look, how to observe,” Hogg said. She made a photograph of a wall, near the Santa Croce basilica, on which someone had put graffiti handprints. “It was a really beautiful sort of image—the hands, and the textured ripple of the wall behind it,” she said. “That was the first serious attempt I made to ",["em","look"]," at something—not photographing a person, just photographing a wall.”"],["p","She stayed in Italy for a year. On returning to England, Hogg moved into the Knightsbridge flat, which she shared with a succession of roommates. She got a job with a photographer on Greek Street, in Soho, and on off-hours she was allowed to use his studio for her own photography, developing images from a series showing visual artists and dancers at work. She also started carrying around her Super 8 camera; she hosted parties but hovered in the background, behind her lens. Swinton, who delivers a nuanced performance in “The Souvenir”—with an Hermès scarf tied under her chin, like the Queen, and a clucking helplessness—recalls the young Hogg as a quiet, watchful presence in the bohemian swirl. “I really believe that the reason Joanna has so many photographs is that deeply, unconsciously, she was living through this time knowing that she would make a piece of work out of it one day,” Swinton told me."],["p","When Hogg was nineteen, she switched her creative focus to film. “I had the slight feeling that still photography wasn’t enough—that I wanted to tell a story,” she said. She had some early encouragement from Derek Jarman, the avant-garde filmmaker, whom she approached in a Soho café, asking to assist him on his next movie, “Caravaggio.” Jarman invited her to visit him at his studio, and she went, bringing along a portfolio of photographs and drawings. “He said, ‘You should start making your own films, rather than come to work on mine,’ ” she recalled. But Hogg wasn’t sure what she wanted to say. She spent months trying to develop a feature film set in Sunderland, a working-class city in the North of England. Hogg had visited Sunderland, a former shipbuilding hub that had fallen into decline, while shooting a photographic series about the work of two visual artists. She wanted to tell the story of the city’s devastation through the figure of a small boy who fears his mother’s imminent death. “But when I sat down to write it I realized I didn’t have the tools to do it,” Hogg said. “I didn’t know, inside out, that place and those characters.”"],["p","Around this time, she met the man with the heroin addiction. He immediately called into question her choice of subject matter. “He sort of threw it back at me,” she recalled. “He was quite critical of the fact that I, from this background, would want to make a film so far from my experience.” These conversations are mercilessly re-created in “The Souvenir.” Hogg set the Sunderland project aside. Her lover’s critique was harsh, but it rang true.

affair that coincides with an artistic reversal: this is where “The Souvenir” begins. The movie poignantly shows Julie channelling her creative energies into the stumbling conduct of her life, rather than into the making of art. Today, when the standard for a young female artist’s self-fashioning has been set by the precocious accomplishments of the likes of Lena Dunham, Hogg’s slower, more inhibited path to self-expression can be painful to watch. Yet this trajectory will be eminently recognizable to any viewer who has felt, especially in early adulthood, as if she were performing the role of herself, rather than simply living it. “I have done big productions, but they were productions in my ",["em","life"],",” Hogg told me. “That phase was very much about me being a protagonist in a production, in a way.”"],["p","Her lover’s secretiveness and deceit—not just about his addiction but also about other aspects of his life—contributed to this dynamic. “Rather than make my own films when I was with him, I was ",["em","in"]," a film—a genre film, a Hitchcock film that had a lot of mystery and intrigue,” Hogg recalled. “I did a lot of detective work, I dressed very glamorously, I went to glamorous places.” “The Souvenir” replicates a luxurious trip to Venice taken by Hogg and her lover; Hogg’s elaborate preparations for the journey extended to commissioning a tailor to make her the kind of travel suit that Janet Leigh would have worn. The night before the couple’s departure, the trip was almost scuppered by an apparent robbery in Hogg’s apartment, in which her jewelry, her cameras, and other valuables were stolen. Hogg quickly realized that her lover had faked the theft, and had sold the items for drugs; nevertheless, the trip went ahead. “I had spent months planning, and didn’t want to give up on the plan,” Hogg said. “The show had to go on, and there was so much in the show—so much dreaming, all the ideas. It was creating a piece of work.”"],["p","In 1981, Hogg enrolled at the National Film and Television School, in Beaconsfield, outside London. Trix Worrell, a creator of British sitcoms, was a classmate, and remembers that, although Hogg had strong opinions, she was discreet in making them known. “The Souvenir” shows Julie’s professors, all male, patronizing her; she absorbs their criticisms with mild good manners. Underneath, Hogg told me, she resented how she was treated. The experience still stings. “Those moments—they are hard to let go of,” she admitted. In “The Souvenir,” Richard Ayoade plays a supremely confident young filmmaker whom Julie encounters at a dinner party; he reappears in Part II, as the director of one of several movies-within-the-movie. Some of the characters in the “Souvenir” films correspond to real people, but Ayoade’s character, Hogg said, is “a composite of all the arrogant film directors I’ve ever met.”"],["p","Hogg, influenced more by her lover than by anyone at film school, developed an appreciation of more stylized cinematic modes. She also had an intense interest in fashion. Worrell said of Hogg, “She was very aware of the next new thing, like the Issey Miyake pleated things—she didn’t flaunt it, but if you came up close it would be ‘That’s a ",["em","really"]," good cut.’ ” Hogg’s graduation film, a short titled “Caprice” (1986), starred Tilda Swinton in a dark fantasia about the fashion-magazine industry, inspired by Technicolor Hollywood musicals. Hogg planned to follow it up with big-budget projects, including a feature film called “London Paris Rome,” which she and a friend, who worked in advertising, pitched to studios as “James Bond meets the cosmetics industry.” The project didn’t get far off the ground; nor did a project called “Gorgeous,” which Hogg described to me as “like ‘Brazil,’ but in a department store.” She said, “As with the Sunderland film, I tended to go with these very ambitious ideas that were almost unrealizable.”"],["p","Instead of making feature films, Hogg found herself making pop-music videos, including one, for the 1987 Johnny Hates Jazz hit “Shattered Dreams,” that reworked ideas from “Caprice.” (It has nineteen million views on YouTube. “I’ve never had such a big audience for my work,” she said, with heavy irony.) Television jobs followed, and they became Hogg’s career for the next dozen years. She directed episodes of soap operas, such as “London Bridge,” about a restaurant in southeast London, and of “Casualty,” a long-running medical drama. “From one series you get asked to do another, and it’s always very flattering to be asked, and then you are working and earning money, and it’s very hard to dig yourself out of that,” she said. “And then the confidence is wearing away a little bit.”"],["p","Hogg did try to experiment, she said, “even if it was a really boring TV series that had nothing of myself in it.” She made one episode of “Casualty” that consisted almost entirely of a single shot, which had to be carefully choreographed in advance. There were less artistically inclined ambitions, too. Hogg was the first female director to work on a show called “London’s Burning,” about firefighters, and she and the other directors competed to see who could shoot the most minutes in one day. “I managed to do a ",["em","ridiculous"]," amount of minutes—which is nothing to be proud of, because it’s nothing to do with quality,” she said. “But there is quite a macho element—you want to prove yourself.”"],["p","In the early two-thousands, Hogg was hired to direct a spinoff of “EastEnders,” the venerable soap opera about working-class Londoners. During filming, she said to herself, “I would really like to be in a different situation, where it is ",["em","my"]," story, and my ideas.” Her sense of restlessness was crystallized by a family tragedy: in 2003, her father, a recreational pilot, died in a plane crash when he was flying solo in the Chiltern Hills. He was seventy-eight. His death opened up a sense of urgency for Hogg. “We had a memorial service a few months later, and I wrote something about him—a kind of poem of my own memories of him,” she told me. “In the process of writing that, I caught something that I wanted to continue, in terms of expressing myself in words.”"],["p","Hogg, then in her early forties, was also coming to terms with another loss: she and Turvey had tried to start a family, but she had failed to become pregnant. “Unrelated,” which she wrote after her father’s death, turns on the experience of Anna, a childless woman in her forties. She shows up at the family vacation of friends and finds herself drawn to the glowing, hedonistic society of their teen-age offspring, rather than to the dull, bourgeois company of “the olds,” as her friends are dismissively called by their children. Hogg told me, “I wanted to show someone who has some fun—I wanted some kind of lightness, as well as the trying for children and that not working out.”"],["p","Hogg had long maintained that her first feature would be a 35-mm. film, but “Unrelated” was shot with a nonprofessional Sony video camera. Unlike most movie productions, in which scenes are shot in the order in which it is most convenient to secure the necessary locations—meaning that an actor may have to play a breakup fight with her romantic partner before enacting their first kiss—“Unrelated” was filmed in narrative order. The actress who played Anna, Kathryn Worth, arrived at the villa in Tuscany several days later than the rest of the cast, in order to simulate the kind of outsider’s discomfort that her character feels. Tom Hiddleston told me, “You’re actually living it as you go, and that means Joanna could adjust the story as she goes. If something happens in the chemistry between this actor and that actor, or someone makes a funny joke, we can make a callback to it later. There was a very exciting sense of creative collaboration in the momentum.”"],["p","While shooting “Unrelated,” Hogg came to prefer very long takes; by the time she made “Archipelago,” she was leaving the camera running for forty minutes for group scenes that would last no more than two minutes in the final cut. Helle le Fevre, who has been the editor on all of Hogg’s feature films, told me, “That allows something to happen that you can’t predict—either the actors maneuver themselves into a very uncomfortable space, or a humorous space, or the sun goes down and it gives a certain intimacy.” Hogg’s predilection for wide, static-camera shots—in which an ensemble can move freely, and the actors’ body language is legibly captured within a photograph-like frame—was a repudiation of the small screen’s demand for closeups and choreographed movement."],["p","In “Archipelago,” Hogg started to work with non-actors in supporting roles, and the couple at the heart of her next film, “Exhibition,” was played by Viv Albertine, the former guitarist of the post-punk band the Slits, and Liam Gillick, a conceptual artist. In the film, the pair have decided to sell their home, a modernist house in West London that serves as a kind of third party in their relationship. Albertine and Gillick first met less than a week before shooting began. “That distance of not knowing someone got translated into a kind of distance that happens over many years in a relationship,” Hogg said. The film, which is virtually plotless, offers an almost voyeuristic insight into the day-to-day existence of two adults working and living in close proximity. It quietly explores the unstated rivalries that arise between creative people with differing degrees of recognition; the sometimes asynchronous nature of sexual arousal; the solidarity of two people who have escaped the framework of bourgeois family life. “Exhibition” has the quality of a documentary—as though it were a film about Albertine and Gillick role-playing as a husband and a wife. Not long before the film was made, Hogg and Turvey moved out of a house, in Notting Hill, where they’d lived for seventeen years, and that willful dismantling of an established life in favor of something new was one of Hogg’s inspirations. “Some people see the film as being about the breakdown of a marriage, but I think it’s the reverse,” she told me. “I think it’s actually about a couple really trying to make a go of something.”"],["p","For “Unrelated,” Hogg wrote a script, but in subsequent movies she discarded that convention, and instead composed for each a narrative of about thirty pages, which reads almost like a short story. A scene from “The Souvenir” is depicted this way: “In the hushed Grand Hotel Piccadilly dining room the other guests, mostly couples, are much older. Anthony likes to point them out; these couples who sit quietly have nothing to say to each other. Whereas his conversation with Julie never dries up. Julie enjoys being the youngest person in the room. Underneath the dining table Julie kicks off her shoes. She places her bare feet on top of Anthony’s monogrammed velvet slippers.” Not every actor sees the text in advance. Tom Burke was given Hogg’s text for “The Souvenir” before filming began, whereas Honor Swinton Byrne arrived every day on the set not knowing what was coming—a strategic replication of Hogg’s original naïveté."],["p","Hogg invited the principals to comb through her diaries and letters, and to explore the interests of their characters. Burke immersed himself in Béla Bartók’s 1918 opera, “Bluebeard’s Castle,” because Anthony listens to it compulsively in the Knightsbridge apartment, his taste displacing Julie’s pop-music preferences. (In a subtle shot, we see Anthony flinch with irritation when Julie dares to put on a punk-rock cassette.) Burke told me, “The work of Joanna’s that I had seen is very naturalistic, but with ‘The Souvenir’ I felt that was being prized open a little. Anthony is very much bringing that other world to Julie, which is intoxicating for her. And their relationship is hermetically sealed, similar to the kind of world that you get in an opera. It doesn’t quite make sense to anyone outside of it, but they have their own logic.” Entire scenes were built around Hogg’s providing a key idea, or phrase, to Burke and Swinton Byrne, then stepping back to let them improvise. Before filming, Hogg gave Burke a recording of a session that her lover had undergone with her therapist. It helped Burke appreciate the lover’s intelligence and magnetism: “He was able to keep the balloon in the air, and talk and talk and talk and talk, and to think very interesting things, and very insightful things—but not actually go to the root of the addiction.”"],["p","Hogg cast Burke, a fixture of British TV and the London stage, as Anthony because so much of her lover’s self-presentation had been a performance; but she needed a nonprofessional to play Julie. Tilda Swinton told me, “She wanted someone who was not an actress and had never wanted to be an actress—someone who would be uncomfortable in front of the camera. People of nineteen or twenty now are much more used to looking at photos of themselves than anybody was in the eighties, and she was looking for someone who didn’t have a selfie face.” Hogg did not immediately think of Swinton Byrne, even though she knows her well—she is her godmother. The role of Julie was cast only two weeks before shooting was to begin. On the first day of filming, which involved a party scene, Swinton Byrne felt very self-conscious about people looking at her. “That fear you see on my face is real,” she said. “I was saying, ‘Joanna, I am so sorry, can you please give me something about what I should be feeling, so that I can feel I am doing Julie justice?’ She said, ‘Just feel uncomfortable.’ I said, ‘Right, O.K. Done.’ ”"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EIn%201988%2C%20when%20Hogg%20first%20started%20sketching%20ideas%20for%20a%20film%20about%20her%20youth%2C%20she%20noted%20that%20the%20story%20might%20be%20so%20expansive%20that%20it%20would%20have%20to%20be%20told%20in%20two%20parts.%20At%20the%20time%2C%20this%20seemed%20like%20a%20grandiose%20notion.%20But%20the%20path%20has%20since%20been%20cleared%20for%20a%20female%20artist%20to%20tell%20an%20epic%20story%20of%20her%20interior%20development.%20Given%20the%20success%20of%20such%20novelists%20as%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2Felena-ferrante%5C%22%3EElena%20Ferrante%3C%2Fa%3E%20and%20%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftag%2FRachel-Cusk%5C%22%3ERachel%20Cusk%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20an%20extended%20telling%20of%20Hogg%E2%80%99s%20story%20no%20longer%20seems%20like%20an%20oversized%20ambition.%20In%20one%20of%20our%20conversations%2C%20Hogg%20told%20me%20that%20she%20did%20not%20have%20time%20to%20regret%20the%20decade%20and%20a%20half%20in%20which%20her%20creativity%20lay%20dormant.%20She%20paused.%20%E2%80%9CThat%E2%80%99s%20not%20completely%20true%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said.%20%E2%80%9CThere%20are%20times%20when%20I%20look%20back%20and%20think%20it%E2%80%99s%20a%20shame%2C%20I%20could%20have%20made%20more%20films.%E2%80%9D%20She%20then%20reasoned%20that%2C%20if%20she%20had%20started%20making%20features%20right%20after%20film%20school%2C%20she%20might%20not%20have%20been%20able%20to%20sustain%20her%20momentum.%20%E2%80%9CAnd%20I%20am%20not%20sure%20that%20I%20would%20have%20been%20making%20the%20films%20I%20am%20now%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20went%20on.%20%E2%80%9CSo%20I%20am%20happy.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20preparing%20to%20make%20Part%20II%20of%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Souvenir%2C%E2%80%9D%20Hogg%20told%20me%2C%20she%20had%20come%20to%20feel%20that%20Part%20I%20somewhat%20exaggerates%20Julie%E2%80%99s%20vulnerability.%20She%20had%20been%20rereading%20old%20notebooks%20and%20diaries%2C%20which%20recorded%20other%20emotions%3A%20all%20the%20arguing%20with%20her%20lover%3B%20her%20constant%20suspicion%20of%20his%20behavior.%20She%20was%20also%20reminded%20of%20her%20complicity%20in%20allowing%20the%20relationship%20to%20take%20the%20course%20it%20did.%20%E2%80%9CI%20am%20going%20through%20a%20process%20of%20sort%20of%20facing%20up%20to%20who%20I%20was%2C%20and%20maybe%20who%20I%20am%20now%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said.%20%E2%80%9CIn%20my%20portrayal%20of%20Julie%2C%20I%20am%20not%20sure%20I%20have%20been%20entirely%20honest%2C%20in%20a%20way.%20It%E2%80%99s%20not%20that%20I%20feel%20I%20have%20done%20something%20wrong%2C%20or%20made%20a%20mistake.%20But%20something%20I%20need%20to%20do%20in%20Part%20II%20is%20have%20Julie%20assessing%20her%20responsibility%20for%20who%20she%20is%2C%20and%20her%20part%20in%20the%20relationship.%20She%20was%20a%20participant%20in%20what%20happened.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ESwinton%20Byrne%20told%20me%20that%20she%20sometimes%20had%20to%20suppress%20an%20impulse%20to%20behave%20in%20ways%20that%20were%20inconsistent%20with%20Hogg%E2%80%99s%20actions%20decades%20earlier.%20Swinton%20Byrne%E2%80%99s%20own%20reactions%20to%20her%20fictional%20lover%E2%80%99s%20perfidies%20were%20more%20indignant%2C%20and%20less%20compliant%2C%20than%20what%20we%20see%20onscreen%20as%20Julie%E2%80%99s.%20In%20one%20excruciating%20scene%2C%20after%20the%20apartment%20robbery%2C%20Julie%20elicits%20an%20admission%20of%20guilt%20from%20Anthony%2C%20only%20to%20end%20up%20apologizing%20to%20him.%20Swinton%20Byrne%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CIt%20was%20so%20agonizing%2C%20and%20frustrating%2C%20and%20heartbreaking%E2%80%94to%20allow%20yourself%20to%20be%20pushed%20around.%E2%80%9D%20These%20differences%20are%20both%20temperamental%20and%20generational.%20The%20film%20exquisitely%20conjures%20a%20period%20in%20which%20it%20was%20common%20for%20a%20bright%20young%20woman%20to%20defer%20to%20a%20man%3B%20an%20imbalance%20of%20experience%20and%20power%20was%20often%20taken%20as%20a%20natural%20state%20of%20affairs.%20Swinton%2C%20recalling%20being%20a%20nineteen-year-old%20adrift%20alongside%20Hogg%2C%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CWe%20were%20lost%2C%20quite%20lost.%20We%20really%20didn%E2%80%99t%20know%20what%20being%20a%20grownup%20was.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EHogg%E2%80%99s%20film%20lays%20bare%20the%20costs%20of%20that%20kind%20of%20love%20affair%2C%20but%20it%20is%20also%20honest%20about%20what%20can%20be%20gained.%20%E2%80%9CI%20sort%20of%20fought%20the%20dynamic%20of%20student%20and%20teacher%2C%20as%20well%20as%20embraced%20it%2C%20because%20I%20didn%E2%80%99t%20like%20being%20condescended%20to%2C%E2%80%9D%20Hogg%20told%20me.%20%E2%80%9CBut%20at%20the%20same%20time%20I%20thought%20to%20myself%2C%20Take%20it%20all%20in.%20And%20there%20was%20a%20lot%20to%20take%20in%2C%20and%20I%20did%20not%20have%20time%20to%20take%20everything%20in%2C%20and%20I%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20alw

1988, when Hogg first started sketching ideas for a film about her youth, she noted that the story might be so expansive that it would have to be told in two parts. At the time, this seemed like a grandiose notion. But the path has since been cleared for a female artist to tell an epic story of her interior development. Given the success of such novelists as ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/elena-ferrante"},"Elena Ferrante"]," and ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Rachel-Cusk"},"Rachel Cusk"],", an extended telling of Hogg’s story no longer seems like an oversized ambition. In one of our conversations, Hogg told me that she did not have time to regret the decade and a half in which her creativity lay dormant. She paused. “That’s not completely true,” she said. “There are times when I look back and think it’s a shame, I could have made more films.” She then reasoned that, if she had started making features right after film school, she might not have been able to sustain her momentum. “And I am not sure that I would have been making the films I am now,” she went on. “So I am happy.”"],["p","In preparing to make Part II of “The Souvenir,” Hogg told me, she had come to feel that Part I somewhat exaggerates Julie’s vulnerability. She had been rereading old notebooks and diaries, which recorded other emotions: all the arguing with her lover; her constant suspicion of his behavior. She was also reminded of her complicity in allowing the relationship to take the course it did. “I am going through a process of sort of facing up to who I was, and maybe who I am now,” she said. “In my portrayal of Julie, I am not sure I have been entirely honest, in a way. It’s not that I feel I have done something wrong, or made a mistake. But something I need to do in Part II is have Julie assessing her responsibility for who she is, and her part in the relationship. She was a participant in what happened.”"],["p","Swinton Byrne told me that she sometimes had to suppress an impulse to behave in ways that were inconsistent with Hogg’s actions decades earlier. Swinton Byrne’s own reactions to her fictional lover’s perfidies were more indignant, and less compliant, than what we see onscreen as Julie’s. In one excruciating scene, after the apartment robbery, Julie elicits an admission of guilt from Anthony, only to end up apologizing to him. Swinton Byrne said, “It was so agonizing, and frustrating, and heartbreaking—to allow yourself to be pushed around.” These differences are both temperamental and generational. The film exquisitely conjures a period in which it was common for a bright young woman to defer to a man; an imbalance of experience and power was often taken as a natural state of affairs. Swinton, recalling being a nineteen-year-old adrift alongside Hogg, said, “We were lost, quite lost. We really didn’t know what being a grownup was.”"],["p","Hogg’s film lays bare the costs of that kind of love affair, but it is also honest about what can be gained. “I sort of fought the dynamic of student and teacher, as well as embraced it, because I didn’t like being condescended to,” Hogg told me. “But at the same time I thought to myself, Take it all in. And there was a lot to take in, and I did not have time to take everything in, and I wasn’t always good at taking everything in. He had a lot to give.” Among the privileges that “The Souvenir” delineates is the opportunity that may be found in the role of protégée, at a phase of life when one is all receptivity. The film underscores the value of being induced into an art of living, of having one’s eyes opened."],["p","One bright afternoon, I joined Hogg at the Wallace Collection. She hadn’t been there for a while; the scenes set in the museum had been filmed at Holkham Hall, a stately home in Norfolk, with a replica of “The Souvenir” hanging on the wall. After ascending a grand staircase to one of the galleries, we stood before Fragonard’s original. Hogg tried to recall what she had thought and felt when she first saw it, forty years earlier. “There was something about seeing myself in the painting and wondering whether there was some message to me in showing me this painting,” she said. “What did he mean? In a way, that’s partly to do with wanting to make the film—it’s like a series of questions of trying to understand who he was, and who he thought I was, and what was conscious and what wasn’t.” Now, she said, the painting had a different meaning to her: “I see the film that I have made—the film itself has become the souvenir to him. It is almost like I am giving something back to him.”"],["p","Hogg had told me earlier that in 1988 she had put the “Souvenir” project aside largely because she had lacked confidence.

The violence redoubles; her loss is just the means to his gain."],["p","Women novelists have been ingeniously dismantling this convention of late, both within the crime-fiction genre (Gillian Flynn’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Gone-Girl-Gillian-Flynn/dp/0307588378/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Gone+Girl&qid=1557759825&s=gateway&sr=8-3"},"Gone Girl"],"”) and outside of it, as in Julia Phillips’s invigoratingly hard-to-classify new novel, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Disappearing-Earth-novel-Julia-Phillips/dp/0525520414/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Disappearing+Earth&qid=1557759845&s=books&sr=1-1"},"Disappearing Earth"],"” (Knopf). Each of the novel’s thirteen chapters is told from the perspective of a different female character, beginning with eleven-year-old Alyona Golosovskaya, who is looking after her younger sister, Sophia, while their mother works during the day. At the beach, the two girls meet a man and, out of innocence and admiration for his magnificent car, accept his offer of a ride. This chapter, titled “August,” ends with him driving the panicked girls off to parts unknown."],["p","How could Alyona and Sophia be so foolish, so untutored in the perils of stranger danger, and what sort of mother would allow her young daughters to wander around unsupervised? The sisters live in Kamchatka, a volcano-studded peninsula in the Russian Far East that is basically inaccessible by land. Dead-girl mysteries are often set in such sleepy, half-forgotten corners of the world: small towns, rural backwaters, suburbs that pride themselves on their tranquillity and safety. Dead girls don’t just force detectives to reckon with their own capacity for evil and virtue; they also cause them to turn over the rocks in insular communities and expose wriggling secrets to the light."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5cd316c45b65a32ea26f5e6a%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225cd316c45b65a32ea26f5e6a%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5cd316c45b65a32ea26f5e6a%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5cd316c45b65a32ea26f5e6a"}]],["p","Several of the older characters in “Disappearing Earth” regard Kamchatka as a fallen paradise. “This never could have taken place in Soviet times,” one woman says, after the abduction of the girls becomes big news in the main city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Anyone too young to remember those golden years, she insists, “can’t imagine how safe it used to be. No foreigners. No outsiders. Opening the peninsula was the biggest mistake our authorities ever made. . . . Now we’re overrun with tourists, migrants. Natives. These criminals.” When a child dares to ask, “Weren’t the natives always here?,” referring to indigenous ethnic minorities that face frequent discrimination, the woman dismisses this reality: “They used to stay in the villages where they belong.” The old regime provided both order and meaning, although who can say how much this woman’s memory has been rosied in retrospect? Later, she mourns “a whole civilization lost.”"],["p","Phillips titles the chapters (with one notable exception) for the months that follow the abduction, but the novel doesn’t much concern itself with the search for the girls. Instead, with each new character’s perspective it builds a portrait of a place. The characters include both ethnic Russians and natives, mostly members of the Even people, reindeer herders who live in Esso, a village to the north. As remote as this world is, readers will find it strangely familiar. Petropavlovsk uncannily resembles a small, overlooked city in the American West, with its old-timers praising the way things used to be, its restless youth dreaming of metropolitan glamour and escape, and the neighboring Indian reservation an object of disdain and official neglect."],["p","One of the Even characters, a woman named Ksyusha, leaves Esso to attend the university in Petropavlovsk on scholarship while juggling a relationship with a Russian man back home. In the traditional-dance group she joins, she meets a Koryak boy who complains about how much more avidly the media have covered the case of the Golosovskaya sisters than it did the disappearance of an Even girl from Esso, three years earlier. Ksyusha remembers that incident well: she barely knew Lilia, the missing girl, but her vanishing “changed the course of Ksyusha’s life.” Afterward, her boyfriend drew closer, insisting on constant check-ins and scheduled phone calls. Ksyusha is grateful; she interprets his possessiveness as cherishing. (The reader, like Ksyusha’s roommate, will have another perspective.)"],["p","The disappearance of the sisters assumes different dimensions as it shapes and is refracted through the lives of the Kamchatkan women. For some, like the thirteen-year-old central character of the chapter titled “September,” it’s merely a remote catastrophe visited on strangers, until the fear it inspires gives her best friend’s mother an excuse to forbid the two girls to see each other. Others view it, as people often view such incidents, as a cautionary example of what happens to women and girls, mothers and daughters, who assume too much freedom. For Lilia’s restive older sister, saddled with two children and a husband who spends most of the year at sea, the tragedy stirs up an old disagreement: Lilia’s mother believes that Lilia was murdered; the sister insists that she escaped to “Moscow, or St. Petersburg, or Luxembourg.” (The younger people in the novel caress the names of foreign cities like rosary beads.)"],["p","Phillips’s characters fight to steer a course between the twin hazards of loss and captivity. A scientist, the only witness to the sisters’ abduction, believes she has fortified herself against disaster:"],["blockquote",["p","You lock up your mind and guard your reactions so nobody, not an interrogator or a parent or a friend, will break in. You earn a graduate degree and a good position. You keep your savings in foreign currency and you pay your bills on time. When your colleagues ask you about your home life, you don’t answer. You work harder. You exercise. Your clothing flatters. You keep the edge of your affection sharp, a knife, so that those near you know to handle it carefully."]],["p","The implication is that joining the global professional class can be nearly as exhausting and cheerless as playing the role of patriotic comrade. And even when you succeed you’re still a woman, and therefore untrustworthy. The police are skeptical about the scientist’s account of a man’s ushering two little girls into his shiny car. They decide that the sisters must have drowned, and the authorities begin trawling the bay."],["p","In other chapters, young mothers chafe at the confinement of family responsibilities, craving the risks that their older counterparts dread. When this generation reminisces, it’s not about the sureties of life under the Soviets but about the freedom of growing up “in the brief reckless period between the Communists’ rigidity and Putin’s strength.” The wife of a police detective investigating the disappearance of the Golosovskaya girls spends her days caring for her infant, pining for her old job, fantasizing about the migrant workers on a building site that she can spy from her apartment balcony—the very men whose foreignness alarms her older neighbors. For her, the migrants, mostly Central Asians, possess “the power to take a woman, to transform her, to turn her life that was growing smaller all the time into an existence that was dark and mighty.” Another young mother leaves her boyfriend in Esso, planning to parlay her job at a local bank into an international transfer. The bank, she hopes, will whisk her away from Kamchatka and her boyfriend’s “garbage palace of a rental house,” with its broken radiator and ankle-deep puddles of freezing water. But she has only enough money to make it back to her parents’ house, little daughter in tow, in a village even more Podunk than Esso."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EAll%20of%20these%20characters%20are%20connected%20to%20one%20another%2C%20directly%20or%20indirectly%2C%20by%20the%20disappearance%20of%20the%20Golosovskaya%20sisters%20or%20of%20Lilia%2C%20even%20if%20few%20of%20them%20devote%20much%20thought%20to%20finding%20out%20what%20happened%20to%20the%20girls.%20The%20bank%20employee%20is%20Ksyusha%E2%80%99s%20brother%E2%80%99s%20girlfriend.%20A%20grief-stricken%20nurse%20in%20another%20chapter%20is%20the%20second%20cousin%20of%20Lilia%E2%80%99s%20mother.%20Each%20woman%E2%80%99s%20identity%20comes%20nested%20in%20enough%20apostrophe-riddled%20relationships%20to%20send%20the%20reader%20turning%20back%20to%20the%20list%20of%20%E2%80%9Cprincipal%20characters%E2%80%9D%20that%20appears%20at%20the%20beginning%20of%20the%20book.%20That%E2%80%99s%20to%20be%20expected%20in%20a%20sequestered%2C%20provincial%20enclave%2C%20isolation%20being%20one%20of%20the%20qualities%20that%20appeal%20to%20crime%20novelists%3A%20all%20that%20shared%20personal%20history%20becomes%20a%20breeding%20ground%20for%20intrigue.%20But%20for%20Phillips%20the%20intricate%20web%20linking%20her%20characters%E2%80%94bonds%20that%20can%20suffocate%2C%20sustain%2C%20or%20expose%E2%80%94is%20not%20a%20mystery%20to%20be%20uncovered%20by%20a%20solitary%20detective.%20The%20official%20investigators%20in%20%E2%80%9CDisappearing%20Earth%E2%80%9D%20dither%20at%20the%20story%E2%80%99s%20periphery%20and%20come%20up%20empty-handed.%20It%20is%20the%20web%20itself%20that%20provides%20the%20solution.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EA%20certain%20literary%20aesthetic%20would%20stop%20short%20of%20providing%20that%20solution%2C%20making%20%E2%80%9CDisappearing%20Earth%E2%80%9D%20more%20a%20collection%20of%20linked%20stories%20than%20a%20cohesive%20narrative.%20The%20fragments%20would%20be%20mournful%20and%20unresolved%2C%20offering%20a%20picture%20of%20Kamchatka%20as%20a%20grim%20place%20populated%20by%20the%20pitiably%20trapped%20and%20bereft.%20This%20is%20not%20Phillips%E2%80%99s%20game%2C%20although%20her%20intentions%20remain%20in%20doubt%20until%20the%20penultimate%20chapter%2C%20%E2%80%9CJune%2C%E2%80%9D%20in%20which%20Marina%2C%20the%20mother%20of%20the%20missing%20girls%2C%20travels%20to%20a%20campground%20outside%20Esso%20for%20a%20%E2%80%9Ctraditional%20festival%20in%20celebration%20of%20the%20region%E2%80%99s%20cultural%20minorities.%E2%80%9D%20Throughout%20the%20novel%2C%20the%20characters%20have%20contradicted%20one%20another%E2%80%99s%20accounts%20on%20points%20large%20and%20small.%20Is%20Ksyusha%E2%80%99s%20boyfriend%20the%20prince%20she%20believes%20him%20to%20be%2C%20or%20the%20brute%20that%20her%20brother%E2%80%99s%20girlfriend%20dismisses%20as%20%E2%80%9Cabout%20as%20agreeable%20as%20a%20feral%20white%20dog%E2%80%9D%3F%20The%20truth%20may%20be%20dependent%20upon%20the%20viewer%E2%80%99s%20perspective%2C%20but%20at%20the%20festival%2C%20where%20several%20of%20the%20novel%E2%80%99s%20characters%20meet%2C%20something%20approaching%20a%20usable%2C%20shared%20version%20of%20reality%20will%20be%20cobbled%20together.%20And%20it%20will%20be%20assembled%20by%20those%20who%20notice%20what%20the%20authorities%20have%20overlooked%20or%20shrugged%20off.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20ending%20of%20%E2%80%9CDisappearing%20Earth%E2%80%9D%20ignites%20an%20immediate%20desire%20to%20reread%20the%20chapters%20leading%20up%20to%20it%3A%20incidents%20and%20characters%20that%20seemed%20trivial%20acquire%20new%20meanings.%20The%20novel%E2%80%99s%20title%20comes%20from%20a%20scary%20story%20that%20Alyona%20tells%20her%20sister%20in%20the%20very%20first%20chapter%2C%20about%20a%20village%20on%20a%20bluff%20overlooking%20the%20ocean%20which%20is%20suddenly%20washed%20away%20by%20a%20tsunami.%20This%20story%20will%20be%20retold%20by%20the%20novel%E2%80%99s%20close%2C%20just%20as%20the%20novel%20will%20retell%20itself.%20What%20appears%20to%20be%20a%20collection%20of%20fragments%2C%20the%20remains%20of%20assorted%20personal%20disasters%20and%20the%20detritus%20of%20a%20lost%20empire%2C%20is%20in%20truth%20capable%20of%20unity.%20For%20the%20heirs%20of%20all%20that%20wreckage%2C%20discovering%20that%20they%20have%20the%20ability%20to%20achieve%20this%20unity%E2%80%94that%20they%20have%20had%20it%20all%20along%E2%80%94is%20the%20one%20great%20act%20of%20detection%20required%20of%20them.%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","All of these characters are connected to one another, directly or indirectly, by the disappearance of the Golosovskaya sisters or of Lilia, even if few of them devote much thought to finding out what happened to the girls. The bank employee is Ksyusha’s brother’s girlfriend. A grief-stricken nurse in another chapter is the second cousin of Lilia’s mother. Each woman’s identity comes nested in enough apostrophe-riddled relationships to send the reader turning back to the list of “principal characters” that appears at the beginning of the book. That’s to be expected in a sequestered, provincial enclave, isolation being one of the qualities that appeal to crime novelists: all that shared personal history becomes a breeding ground for intrigue. But for Phillips the intricate web linking her characters—bonds that can suffocate, sustain, or expose—is not a mystery to be uncovered by a solitary detective. The official investigators in “Disappearing Earth” dither at the story’s periphery and come up empty-handed. It is the web itself that provides the solution."],["p","A certain literary aesthetic would stop short of providing that solution, making “Disappearing Earth” more a collection of linked stories than a cohesive narrative. The fragments would be mournful and unresolved, offering a picture of Kamchatka as a grim place populated by the pitiably trapped and bereft. This is not Phillips’s game, although her intentions remain in doubt until the penultimate chapter, “June,” in which Marina, the mother of the missing girls, travels to a campground outside Esso for a “traditional festival in celebration of the region’s cultural minorities.” Throughout the novel, the characters have contradicted one another’s accounts on points large and small. Is Ksyusha’s boyfriend the prince she believes him to be, or the brute that her brother’s girlfriend dismisses as “about as agreeable as a feral white dog”? The truth may be dependent upon the viewer’s perspective, but at the festival, where several of the novel’s characters meet, something approaching a usable, shared version of reality will be cobbled together. And it will be assembled by those who notice what the authorities have overlooked or shrugged off."],["p","The ending of “Disappearing Earth” ignites an immediate desire to reread the chapters leading up to it: incidents and characters that seemed trivial acquire new meanings. The novel’s title comes from a scary story that Alyona tells her sister in the very first chapter, about a village on a bluff overlooking the ocean which is suddenly washed away by a tsunami. This story will be retold by the novel’s close, just as the novel will retell itself. What appears to be a collection of fragments, the remains of assorted personal disasters and the detritus of a lost empire, is in truth capable of unity. For the heirs of all that wreckage, discovering that they have the ability to achieve this unity—that they have had it all along—is the one great act of detection required of them. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7c36cecf40192141d5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Writers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"slug":"writers"},{"id":"5c2e1d4422d4972cd5b83348","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Disappearances","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"disappearances"},{"id":"5c2fa8a35b0bef2942ea80c2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5cd2fb53a21d1c027f732bf1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Julia

Simons, who plays Jonah, a terrible person, on HBO’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/veep"},"Veep"],",” lives in Los Angeles with his wife, a public-school teacher, and their seven-year-old twins. On a recent morning, he was in a recording studio in Chelsea, standing in a circle with the four hosts of “Story Pirates,” a podcast for children that is built around manic enactments of stories sent in by children. Recent submissions to the show include “The Dad Who Inhaled a Spider and Kept Coughing and Coughing,” “Where Do the Body Parts Go?,” “The Penguin Would Probably Forget,” and “Be Still and Know That I Am God.”"],["p","In the final season of “Veep,” which just concluded, Jonah—who has at times been disparaged as Jonad, Hepatitis J, and the Pointless Giant—ran for President. “Veep” has been largely hidden from the Simons twins, a girl and a boy, who were born during Season 1. But they are devoted to “Story Pirates,” and Simons had asked to be a guest. Lee Overtree, who co-founded the group—which also performs in schools—had sent Simons a script the previous afternoon. “I’m not kidding, I’m so starstruck,” Simons told Overtree. “When I saw your name in the e-mail . . .”"],["p","Simons was planning to surprise his children with his guest appearance, but he feared that they might be annoyed. Rachel Wenitsky, the show’s head writer, who was standing beside him, said, “We’ve had other guests, where their children say, ‘What are you doing in ",["em","my"]," show? I see you all the time. This is my space.’ ”"],["p","Simons laughed. “Yes, ‘Why would you ruin this?’ ”"],["p","They did a sound check. Simons said that he thought he’d seen a “Story Pirates” stage show in Chicago, sometime around 2002."],["p","“There’s a company in Chicago, Barrel of Monkeys, that is a similar thing,” Overtree said, treading carefully. “We both grew out of the same college theatre group.”"],["p","“Oh, no, wait a minute, am I bringing up some bad blood?” Simons asked, wide-eyed."],["p","“No, everything’s cool,” Overtree said. “We like ",["em","them"],".”"],["p","As they began recording, Overtree coached Simons. “There’s no ‘too big’ here,” he said. “Things are either the most important thing or the worst thing that’s ever happened to you.”"],["p","For half an hour, Simons played the part of someone flung, by slingshot, onto a flying pirate ship. Much of the work was sustained screaming."],["p","When it was done, Overtree said, “That was wonderful. Everyone did a really great job.” He added, with light irony, “Especially you, Tim.”"],["p","“Thank you,” Simons replied. “I need this constant validation. We all ended up here for a reason.”"],["p","A few hours later, Simons was being driven through midtown to a recording of “Late Night with Seth Meyers.” He said that Tony Hale, his “Veep” colleague, once told him that he should maintain a list of personal stories that might work on talk shows. “It was ‘If you think of something that seems lame or cheesy, write it down,’ ” Simons said."],["p","Earlier, in a pre-interview phone call with a “Late Night” producer, Simons had looked at his list. He couldn’t remember what he’d meant by “Winter soup in a blender,” but some of the other material was useful: his daughter’s bedtime remark that all adults are monsters pretending to be human; something about golf; his grandfather turning his head to light a cigarette and missing the raising of the flag on Iwo Jima. And, he said, “a story about how I got a bunch of text messages about Gary Cole’s dick.” (On “Veep,” Cole played Kent Davison, a political strategist.)"],["p","In his dressing room, at Rockefeller Center, Simons reflected on the story-writing skills of his children. “We asked them to write stories for my dad’s seventieth birthday,” he said. “They didn’t turn out great. They really wandered. It was woods-heavy. Everything took place in the woods.”"],["p","Before a cooking demonstration by Rachael Ray, the Food Network star, Simons was called to the stage for his interview.

Walk through a narrow, fluorescent-lit hallway, past window displays of handheld devices and accessories, and suddenly you’re in a tiny, brightly painted oasis, eating—under the watchful eye of the Dalai Lama—from a limited menu of delicious Himalayan food: steamed momos, a type of dumpling similar to a Chinese bao, plus a handful of noodle dishes and stir-fries."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5cd3638d3e22812e9dda473b%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225cd3638d3e22812e9dda473b%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5cd3638d3e22812e9dda473b%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5cd3638d3e22812e9dda473b"}]],["p","In September, the owners expanded into a second place. Lhasa Fresh Food is significantly easier to find: it’s in a regular old storefront, directly accessible from the street, a stone’s throw from Elmhurst Hospital. On two recent weekend evenings, it was easy to claim a seat in the comparatively large dining room, a fairly empty-feeling space decorated with little more than a framed photo of Anthony Bourdain posing with the owner (he featured the first place on his show “Parts Unknown”), a poster of a village beneath a mountain range, and an enormous flat-screen TV blaring “Paw Patrol” one night and alluring Tibetan music videos another.

Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend and a former Rhodes Scholar and Navy veteran, lives with his husband, Chasten, a schoolteacher, in an old house on the same block as Buttigieg’s parents, in a neighborhood where, when he was growing up, in the nineteen-eighties, the factories lay in ruins, the wind whistling through their broken windows just another sound of his childhood, along with “crickets in the summer, crows in the fall, and all year long the echoing horns of trains rumbling through in the night on their way to Chicagoland.” Buttigieg’s stirring, honest, and often beautiful book is a story of how the people of South Bend rebuilt their Rust Belt city, and made it a better place, and it’s an argument for what it means to answer a calling, and why it’s important to ask, again and again, “what each of us owes to the country.”"],["p","Elizabeth Warren’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/This-Fight-Our-Battle-Americas/dp/1250120616/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=This+Fight+Is+Our+Fight%3A+The+Battle+to+Save+America%E2%80%99s+Middle+Class&qid=1557760317&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull"},"This Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America’s Middle Class"],"” (Picador) is part memoir, part political manifesto, and it hits all kinds of nails right smack on their heads, with the hammer of a political Thor. Warren, who is not only a Massachusetts senator but also a scholar (her book has footnotes), tells the story of her life alongside the stories of other people’s lives to demonstrate how conservatives have destroyed the American middle class, like moths eating holes in your sweaters. Warren grew up in Oklahoma, the youngest of four children. When her father lost his job, in the early nineteen-sixties, and the family lost their station wagon and very nearly their house, her mother, who had a high-school education and no job experience, supported them by getting a minimum-wage job at Sears. That’s no longer possible, Warren argues, and there’s no disputing her evidence: “Adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage today is lower than it was in 1965—about 24 percent lower.” The nation’s largest employer is Walmart, which reported $14.69 billion in profits in 2015. The seven members of the family who founded the company, the Waltons, “have more money than 40 percent of our nation’s population put together,” but Walmart’s wildly underpaid employees get by only with assistance from the federal government. Warren writes, “The next time you drive into a Walmart parking lot, pause for a second to note that this Walmart—like the more than five thousand other Walmarts across the country—costs taxpayers about $1 million in direct subsidies to the employees who don’t earn enough money to pay for an apartment, buy food, or get even the most basic health care for their children.”"],["p","Buttigieg, who is thirty-seven, didn’t witness the decline that Warren, sixty-nine, has witnessed. “I never did see those factories off Main Street and Indiana Avenue throbbing with activity, or the thousands of people who worked there pouring into Robertson’s Department Store on a Thursday evening for a family night out,” he writes. If he had, he’d miss them, but he didn’t, and he doesn’t, and he isn’t interested in the nation’s former glories or in its “vanished past” but in what he believes to be its future, of startups and small businesses and smart streets and farmers’ markets and religious traditions and civic virtue. Warren, who knew those factories off Main Street, is angrier. “What has happened to this country?” she asks herself, lying in bed in the dark the night after Senate Republicans defeated a bill that would have reduced the interest rate on college debt. “What has gone so horribly wrong that democratically elected officials can offer a big wet kiss to rich people and giant corporations while they spit on students?” Buttigieg argues with more art, Warren with more force.

I’m running for district attorney and I hope to have your support,” a young and exuberant Harris told shoppers rolling their carts through the parking lot of a supermarket in San Francisco in 2003, when she first ran for public office. “In truth I would have settled for them just remembering my name,” she confesses, in her clear-eyed and affecting memoir, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Truths-We-Hold-American-Journey/dp/0525560718/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=The+Truths+We+Hold%3A+An+American+Journey&qid=1557760353&s=books&sr=1-2"},"The Truths We Hold: An American Journey"],"” (Penguin Press). Campaign books, their jackets plastered with photographs of the candidates, beam their smiles at voters from every airport bookstore and wave at political junkies from every hepped-up, hot-takes Amazon home page.

It’s a moving testament to the American experiment and to the unprecedented diversity of this election’s Democratic field that so many of these candidates explain how to pronounce their names or to locate on a map the part of the world their family came from. This didn’t start with Barack Hussein Obama. (“People call me ‘Alabama,’ ” he said on the campaign trail. “They call me ‘Yo Mama.’ And that’s my supporters!”) And it isn’t even really new (“always pronounced Ra-gan,” Ronald Reagan told readers in his first memoir). But it keeps getting more interesting. Harris’s father was born in Jamaica, her mother in southern India. Her grandfather P. V. Gopalan fought for India’s independence.

Her father’s grandparents all came from Slovenia; “Klobuchar means ‘hatmaker’ in Slovene,” but in the U.S. the Klobuchar men worked in the mines. “My last name is hard to pronounce,” Klobuchar writes, telling a story about being called on in her first-year torts class, in law school, to answer the question of which theory applied in a hypothetical case, and giving the answer as “foreseeability” (awarding damages based on whether someone could have foreseen the consequences).

I woke up and went to bed determined and focused.” Sometimes Presidential candidates write books about their vision for the country; sometimes they write books about themselves. And then, sometimes, their vision for America is a vision of themselves. Most recent campaign books aim to combine memoir and platform, no mean feat. In trying to move from their lives to their ideas, both Booker and Gillibrand lose their way and end up writing a lot about their clothes and their diets, producing books that read like the sort of self-help paperbacks you’d see on a rack next to the drugstore cash register: Selfies in Courage."],["p","It’s not necessary to write a book about your life in order to run for President.

the nineteen-sixties, the books Presidential candidates wrote weren’t usually memoirs; they were collections of speeches. In an age of arduous travel, printing speeches was an excellent way to get ideas to voters.

Grant” was published in 1885. Grant left office deeply in debt and dying from cancer, and wrote the book because he needed the money. “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Harry-S-Truman-Decisions/dp/156852062X/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=The+Memoirs+of+Harry+S.+Truman&qid=1557760528&s=books&sr=1-2"},"The Memoirs of Harry S. Truman"],"” appeared, in two volumes, in 1955 and 1956. Like Grant, Truman had very little money when he left the White House, in 1953; he wrote because he needed the cash—he was the first President to do a book signing—and from a sense of obligation: “I have often thought in reading the history of our country how much is lost to us because so few of our Presidents have told their own stories.”"],["p","Ex-Presidents are more candid than would-be Presidents. The success of Truman’s book inspired political candidates to experiment with more intimate kinds of writing. In 1957, in “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Profiles-Courage-John-F-Kennedy/dp/0060530626/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Profiles+in+Courage&qid=1557760542&s=books&sr=1-1"},"Profiles in Courage"],",” John F. Kennedy offered the reader the chance to detect the real man in the men he admired (in a book he did not write). In “Six Crises” (1962), Richard Nixon drafted the chapter about his Checkers speech, itself an intimate confession, claiming that it had made his cocker spaniel more famous than F.D.R.’s Scottish terrier. Still, candidates kept publishing speeches and addresses: in 1964, in “The Cause Is Mankind: A Liberal Program for Modern America,” Hubert Humphrey wrote, “We plead for progress, for greater understanding, for a more compassionate approach to our own and to world problems.” Lyndon Johnson did the same, albeit with sterner prose, in “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/My-Hope-America-Lyndon-Johnson/dp/B006P3WLSK/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_4?keywords=My+Hope+for+America+lyndon+johnson&qid=1557760569&s=books&sr=1-4-fkmrnull"},"My Hope for America"],"”: “Our land is young. Our strength is great. Our course is far from run.” But he also offered something more personal: “I know what poverty means to people. I have been unemployed. I have stood in an employment office, waiting for an assignment and a placement. I have shined shoes as a boy. I have worked on a highway crew from daylight until dark for a dollar a day.” Surprisingly, in “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Seek-Newer-World-Robert-Kennedy/dp/4871877841/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=%3DTo+Seek+a+Newer+World+kennedy&qid=1557760588&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull"},"To Seek a Newer World"],",” a book that Robert F. Kennedy published in 1967, while preparing for his Presidential bid, the chapter called “Youth” isn’t about his childhood; it’s about the discontent of younger Americans, their opposition to the war in Vietnam, and their disillusionment with liberalism. And, in what amounted to a gift for Nixon, George McGovern, weeks before the 1972 Democratic Convention, inexplicably published his 1953 doctoral dissertation, a study of the great coalfield war of

In 1989, Edwin Meese, who served as the Attorney General under Reagan, was paid about a quarter of a million dollars, talked about how much he enjoyed the writing process, and then apparently never wrote a page of his proposed “Witness to History: Power and Politics in the Reagan White House.” Journalism got soft—in 1980, two-thirds of political news stories concerned policy reporting and analysis; only about half did in 2000—candidates felt a growing need to write books, especially because, as it turns out, the people who are most likely to influence other people’s political opinions are the people who read the most books."],["p","Publishers wanted to publish these books, and candidates wanted them published, but that didn’t mean candidates wanted to write them.

Joe Biden, in his latest memoir, “Promise Me, Dad,” reports that Obama loaned him money, out of his royalties. “Promise Me, Dad” is a hybrid, part ex-Vice-Presidential memoir, part candidate autobiography. It recounts Biden’s chief accomplishments during his two terms in Obama’s White House, but, more, it recounts, with deep sorrow, how Biden decided not to run for the Democratic nomination in 2016. That story has partly to do with Obama, who discouraged him, but mainly to do with Biden’s grief over the illness and death of his son Beau. If you read Biden’s two memoirs together, you can see how Beau’s suffering would have brought back, for Biden, Beau’s months in the hospital, as a little boy, after he and his brother were injured in the car accident that killed Biden’s first wife and their young daughter. “I understood the difference between an electoral loss and a real loss,” Biden writes, of a moment when he is just about to throw his hat in the ring for the 2016 race and, stopping at an Air Force base in Colorado, a man who served with Beau calls out to him, and Biden, falling apart, has to rush back into a waiting car to cry.

Castro headed to a lavish party hosted by the Clinton campaign in the glass-ceilinged Javits Center. That ball-dropping feeling? It didn’t last. Bernie Sanders was at his house in Burlington, Vermont, with a few friends, platters of cold cuts, and bowls of potato chips.

first documented extinction of 2019 occurred on New Year’s Day, with the death of a Hawaiian tree snail named George. George, who was about an inch long, had a grayish body, grayish tentacles, and a conical shell striped in beige and brown. He was born in captivity, in Honolulu, and had spent his unassuming life oozing around his terrarium, consuming fungi. Researchers with Hawaii’s forestry department had tried to find a partner for him—George was a hermaphrodite, but he needed a mate in order to reproduce—and when they couldn’t they concluded that he was the last of his kind, ",["em","Achatinella apexfulva"],". A few days after he went, presumably gently, into that good night, the department posted a eulogy under the heading “",["em",{"class":"small"},"farewell to a beloved snail . . . and a species"],".” “Unfortunately, he is survived by none,” it observed."],["p","George’s passing prompted a spate of headlines, and then, it seems safe to say, was forgotten. Americans have, by now, grown inured to “last of” stories, which appear with the unsurprising regularity of seasonal dessert recipes. (George the snail was named for Lonesome George, a Pinta Island tortoise from the Galápagos, also the last of his kind, who died in 2012.) In February, the Australian government declared a ratlike creature known as the Bramble Cay melomys to be extinct. The melomys, found on a single low-lying island between Australia and Papua New Guinea, appears to have been done in by climate change, which has shrunk its habitat and brought ever more damaging flooding. Then, in April, Chinese state media reported that the last known female Yangtze giant softshell turtle had died. “Her species might die with her,” the Washington ",["em","Post"]," noted."],["p","Last week, an international group of scientists issued what the ",["em","Times"]," called “the most exhaustive look yet at the decline in biodiversity.” The findings were grim. On the order of a million species are now facing extinction, “many within decades.” “What’s at stake here is a liveable world,” Robert Watson, the chairman of the group, Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, told ",["em","Science"],"."],["p","The U.N.-backed ",["a",{"href":"https://www.ipbes.net/"},"I.P.B.E.S."]," is to flora and fauna what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is to the atmosphere. Based in Bonn, it is funded by a hundred and thirty-two member nations, including the United States. More than three hundred experts contributed to its latest assessment, which runs to more than fifteen hundred pages."],["p","The authors trace two diverging trend lines: one upward-sloping, for people, and one sloping downward, for everything else. During the past fifty years, the planet’s human population has doubled. In that same period, the size of the global economy has quadrupled, and global trade has grown tenfold. If hundreds of millions of people around the world are still mired in poverty, there are many more people living in prosperity today than ever before."],["p","To keep nearly eight billion people fed, not to mention housed, clothed, and hooked on YouTube, humans have transformed most of the earth’s surface. Seventy-five per cent of the land is “significantly altered,” the I.P.B.E.S. noted in a summary of its report, which was released last week in Paris. In addition, “66 per cent of the ocean area is experiencing increasing cumulative impacts, and over 85 per cent of wetlands (area) has been lost.” Approximately half the world’s coral cover is gone. In the past ten years alone, at least seventy-five million acres of “primary or recovering forest” have been destroyed."],["p","Habitat destruction and overfishing are, for now, the main causes of biodiversity declines, according to the I.P.B.E.S., but climate change is emerging as a “direct driver” and is “increasingly exacerbating the impact of other drivers.” Its effects, the report notes, “are accelerating.” Watson wrote last week, in the ",["em","Guardian,"]," that “we cannot solve the threats of human-induced climate change and loss of biodiversity in isolation. We either solve both or we solve neither.”"],["p","How long can the two trend lines continue to head in opposite directions? This is the key question raised by the report, and it may turn out to be the key question of the century. Many documented species have already disappeared—to take the example of Hawaiian tree snails, ",["em","Achatinella apexfulva"]," is just one of hundreds of species that have been lost—and probably even more vanished before they could be identified. Many others, like the Yangtze giant softshell turtle, are functionally extinct."],["p","So far, it could be argued, the casualties haven’t slowed us down. The I.P.B.E.S. report cautions, however, against assuming that this pattern will continue. Nature, it succinctly observes, “is essential for human existence.” The report points to pollinators as one group of organisms that humans can’t readily do without. Ninety per cent of flowering plants and seventy-five per cent of all types of food crops rely on pollination by animals—birds, bats, and (mostly) insects. Cash crops including coffee, cocoa, and almonds are pollinator-dependent. In many regions, important pollinators, like native bees, are in decline. It’s not clear exactly why, but probably one of the major factors is an increasing reliance on synthetic pesticides, which don’t distinguish between insects that are useful and those that are unwanted. These chemicals are supposed to prevent crop failures; the danger is that they may end up causing them."],["p","As much as six hundred billion dollars’ worth of annual agricultural production “is at risk as a result of pollinator loss,” the I.P.B.E.S. warned. In an earlier report, on pollinators and the food supply, the group predicted that “total pollinator loss” would decrease production of the most important dependent crops “by more than 90 per cent.”"],["p","We would, it seems, be well advised to shift course, if only for our own, species-centric reasons. And, according to the I.P.B.E.S., there is still time for “transformative changes” in the “production and consumption of energy, food, feed, fibre and water.” Regrettably, though, all signs point to more of the same. In 2018, carbon-dioxide emissions from the energy sector rose to a new high of thirty-six billion tons. Also in 2018, nearly thirty million acres of tropical forest were lost—an area the size of Pennsylvania.

They start to melt in March, and at higher elevations—some villages in Ladakh sit more than fifteen thousand feet above sea level—the process can last through July.

The hundred and thirty-one short essays that make up this provocative history of France cover a striking array of topics: the Chauvet cave paintings, the transformation of French Guiana into a penal colony, Chanel No. 5. The aim of this disparateness is to replace a nationalist narrative of linear progression, from the Gauls to now, with a web of surprising transnational connections. France’s role in the early Renaissance is linked to its military expansion in Naples; the fervor surrounding the visions of St. Bernadette of Lourdes, in 1858, is seen in terms of viral news, foreshadowing the global spread of the 1968 protests."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5cd4778892eb652e91bb6bb8%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225cd4778892eb652e91bb6bb8%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5cd4778892eb652e91bb6bb8%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5cd4778892eb652e91bb6bb8"}]],["p",["strong",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/What-You-Have-Heard-True/dp/0525560378/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=what+you+have+heard+is+true&qid=1557764580&s=gateway&sr=8-1"},"What You Have Heard Is True"]],["em",", by Carolyn Forché (Penguin)"],". This memoir by a noted American poet recounts the consequences of an unexpected visit, in the late seventies, from the humanitarian activist Leonel Gómez Vides. He invited her to El Salvador, then on the brink of civil war, to see, as he put it, “Vietnam, from the beginning.” The corruption, deprivation, and state-sponsored terrorism she witnessed shaped her writing and her life. Forché vividly evokes her complex relationship with her mentor and with organizers, laborers, and religious leaders whose courage in the face of atrocity taught her that “resistance to oppression begins when people realize deeply within themselves that something better is possible.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5cd477885b65a32ea26f6014%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225cd477885b65a32ea26f6014%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5cd477885b65a32ea26f6014%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5cd477885b65a32ea26f6014"}]],["p",["strong",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Hold-Fast-Your-Crown-Novel/dp/1590519752/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=hold+fast+your+crown&qid=1557764619&s=gateway&sr=8-1"},"Hold Fast Your Crown"]],["em",", by Yannick Haenel, translated from the French by Teresa Lavender Fagan (Other Press)"],". The narrator of this audacious novel is a disenchanted novelist whose hopes reside in an unfilmable screenplay about Herman Melville. Obsessed with the fugitive nature of greatness, he drinks heavily in his Paris apartment and compulsively watches “Apocalypse Now” and “The Deer Hunter.” When he gets the phone number of the latter film’s reclusive director, he embarks on a chaotic quest to realize his vision, coming into proximity with Isabelle Huppert, a terror attack, and a Dalmatian he proceeds to lose.

Rosewood (Europa)"],". A young Vietnamese woman, sent alone to America at the age of twelve, narrates this début novel, which navigates a lonely adulthood in New York while excavating difficult memories of home. “Children don’t forget easily,” she says, chronicling an upbringing in a military camp where her mother had sought refuge from political turmoil. There, her only friends were a soldier-cum-caretaker and a girl with whom she created a comforting but dangerous fantasy world. Doubles haunt the novel: a New York neighbor acts as a stand-in for the soldier, and the narrator becomes obsessed with a troubled, capricious woman resembling her lost friend. The novel poignantly conjures the difficulties of reconciling the present with “an ungraspable history.”"]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5c377931890a092c77fb48ba","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c377931890a092c77fb48ba","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Books","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"books"}]}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[],"contentType":"article","contributors":[],"dek":"","formatting":{},"hed":"Briefly

thinking about the dynamics of power,” Brendan Fernandes, an artist, said the other day, on the Upper East Side. He is thirty-nine, with a shaved head, a trimmed beard, and an industrial earring that runs across the top of his left ear like a curtain rod. He wore a sweatshirt that read “Reigning Champ.” Fernandes, a former dancer, was about to headline the Young Collectors Party, at the ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/guggenheim-museum"},"Guggenheim"],", and had been given license to put on “performative interventions” with the theme “ballet kink.” The casting call was for “authoritative bodies.” Dancers would also have to be trained in ballet and O.K. with rope bondage."],["p","Tickets were selling for two hundred and fifty dollars. “When I was a young dancer, we would be at the barre and développé our legs up, and the teacher would sometimes bring a flame underneath,” Fernandes recalled. “If you bring a leg down, you get burnt!” That’s power, he’d thought. “We call our teachers ballet masters.” That’s kind of kinky, he’d considered. After college, two of his dancer friends became dominatrices. “There is pain in ballet, but there is also pleasure,” he’d concluded. This was on his mind when the Guggenheim called."],["p","Fernandes was born in Nairobi. His family emigrated when he was nine (“It wasn’t a safe place at that point”), settling in the suburbs of Toronto. He was Mr. Mistoffelees in “Cats” and then got into ballet and punk rock. “I danced all the way through college,” he said. But he injured his hamstring: “I had to leave ballet.” He got a master’s degree, moved around a lot, and kept making art. His recent work includes “",["a",{"href":"http://www.brendanfernandes.ca/emergency-rave"},"Emergency Rave"],",” an homage to those who lost their lives in the Pulse night-club shooting, in Orlando, and “",["a",{"href":"http://www.brendanfernandes.ca/the-master-and-form"},"The Master and Form"],",” in which dancers hold ballet poses on metal structures—that one he’s putting on anew for the Whitney Biennial. Then he’s off to the Smithsonian, M.C.A. Chicago, and the Noguchi Museum, where his dancers will have to sit perfectly still in rocking chairs."],["p","Before the party, Fernandes arrived at the Guggenheim to meet the nine dancers he’d recruited. He wouldn’t give them choreography so much as patterns and ideas. The ballet world, like everywhere, is still reckoning with sex scandals in its institutions, some of which his collaborators had danced for. Might this performance objectify their bodies? “This piece is about creating empowerment,” Fernandes said. The key to kink is consent, he explained. “I’m a really nice master.”"],["p","The group gathered in a circle. On either side of Fernandes sat a big guy, Vincent Tiley, wearing military boots, and a small guy, Ming Chang, dressed in a black T-shirt. They were the rope-bondage aficionados. Fernandes’s plan was to dress each dancer in a decorative harness, then constrict the men and suspend them one at a time from a truss while the female dancers bourréed and slinked around. “I want you to think, How do I create freedom if I don’t have that body part to move?” he said. The dancers nodded. “If you think, I don’t want to be tied up anymore, talk to Vincent.”"],["p","“I just want to say a few things about rope?” Chang interjected. “What I want to emphasize is safety. So, whatever you do, don’t go around the neck with the rope.” The dancers nodded."],["p","“Who wants to be first?” Fernandes asked."],["p","Nico Brown, a dancer with a mustache, raised his hand: “Ohmigod.”"],["p","“Nico’s first,” Fernandes said."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F5cd4c2d1b36101408ccecac1%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225cd4c2d1b36101408ccecac1%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F5cd4c2d1b36101408ccecac1%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5cd4c2d1b36101408ccecac1"}]],["p","“The first one to get murdered,” another dancer joked.

good Atheist position articulated.” She explained, “I cannot engage with an atheism that does not express itself.”"],["p","She who hath ears to hear, let her hear. One of the most beautifully succinct expressions of secular faith in our bounded life on earth was provided not long after Christ supposedly conquered death, by Pliny the Elder, who called down “a plague on this mad idea that life is renewed by death!” Pliny argued that belief in an afterlife removes “Nature’s particular boon,” the great blessing of death, and merely makes dying more anguished by adding anxiety about the future to the familiar grief of departure. How much easier, he continues, “for each person to trust in himself,” and for us to assume that death will offer exactly the same “freedom from care” that we experienced before we were born: oblivion."],["p","No doubt much will depend on our definitions of “atheist” and “good.” But, if Pliny is too antique for Robinson, listen to Montaigne: the Montaigne who professed a nominal Christianity but proceeded as if his formal belief were essentially irrelevant to his daily existence, and perhaps even at odds with it; the Montaigne whose wanton pagan invocation of “fortune” in his essays provoked Vatican censors. Or attend to the work and life of Chekhov, the good nonbelieving doctor who asserted that his “holy of holies” was the human body, the writer whose adulterous characters in “The Lady with the Little Dog” stop to look at the sea near Yalta and are reminded that their small drama is nothing alongside the water’s timeless indifference:"],["blockquote",["p","And in this constancy, in this complete indifference to the life and death of each of us, there lies hid, perhaps, a pledge of our eternal salvation, of the unceasing movement of life upon earth, of unceasing progress towards perfection. Sitting beside a young woman who in the dawn seemed so lovely, soothed and spellbound in these magical surroundings—the sea, mountains, clouds, the open sky—Gurov thought how in reality everything is beautiful in this world when one reflects: everything except what we think or do ourselves when we forget our human dignity and the higher aims of our existence."]],["p","Or ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/James%20Baldwin"},"James Baldwin"],", that great recovering Christian, who once wrote, “I have always felt that a human being could only be saved by another human being.” Or Primo Levi, who, when faced with death in Auschwitz, was briefly tempted to pray for rescue, and then did not pray, lest he blaspheme his own secularity.

are visions of the secular. A systematic articulation of the atheistic world view, the one Marilynne Robinson may have been waiting for, is provided by an important new book, Martin Hägglund’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/This-Life-Secular-Spiritual-Freedom/dp/1101870400/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=This+Life%3A+Secular+Faith+and+Spiritual+Freedom&qid=1557761344&s=books&sr=1-1-catcorr"},"This Life: Secular Faith and Spiritual Freedom"],"” (Pantheon). Hägglund doesn’t mention any of the writers I quoted, because he is working philosophically, from general principles. But his book can be seen as a long footnote to Pliny, and shares the Roman historian’s humane emphasis: we need death, as a blessing; eternity is at best incoherent or meaningless, and at worst terrifying; and we should trust in ourselves rather than put our faith in some kind of transcendent rescue from the joy and pain of life. Hägglund’s book involves deep and demanding readings of St. Augustine, Kierkegaard, Marx, and Martin Luther King, Jr. (with some Theodor Adorno, Charles Taylor, Thomas Piketty, and Naomi Klein thrown in), but it is always lucid, and is at its heart remarkably simple. You could extract its essence and offer it to thirsty young atheists."],["p","His argument is that religious traditions subordinate the finite (the knowledge that life will end) to the eternal (the “sure and certain hope,” to borrow a phrase from the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, that we will be released from pain and suffering and mortality into the peace of everlasting life). A characteristic formulation, from St. Paul’s Epistle to the Colossians, goes as follows: “Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth, for you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.” You die into Christ and thus into eternity, and life is just the antechamber to an everlasting realm that is far more wondrous than anything on earth. Hägglund, by contrast, wants us to fix our ideals and attention on this life, and more of it—Camus’s “longing, yes, to live, to live still more.” Hägglund calls this “living on,” as opposed to living forever."],["p","His notion of religion seems to be northern-European Christian first and foremost; he is quiet about Judaism, whose practices are sensibly grounded in the here and now, and which lacks the intense emphasis on the afterlife characteristic of Islam and Christianity. (And he has very little to say about, for example, Hinduism.) Yet he wields a definition of religious faith wide enough for his purposes: “any form of belief in an eternal being or an eternity beyond being, either in the form of a timeless repose (such as nirvana), a transcendent God, or an immanent, divine Nature.” That should cover most contenders. Elsewhere, Hägglund defines “the religious aspiration to eternity” as part of any ideal that promises us that we will be “absolved from the pain of loss.” Defining the religious ideal in this way enables him to characterize, however unfairly, Stoicism, Buddhism’s Nirvana (a detachment from everything that is finite), and even Spinoza’s “pure contemplation as the highest good” as essentially religious."],["p","The problem with eternity is not that it doesn’t exist (Hägglund is uninterested in the pin dancing of proof and disproof) but that it is undesirable and incoherent; it kills meaning and collapses value. This is a difficult truth to learn, because we are naturally fearful of loss, and therefore attached to the idea of eternal restoration. Hägglund, who was born and reared in Sweden and now teaches comparative literature at Yale, begins his book by telling us that he returns every summer to the northern-Swedish landscape he knows from his childhood. His love of the place is premised on the knowledge that he will not always be able to return; that he, or it, will not be there forever:"],["blockquote",["p","When I return to the same landscape every summer, part of what makes it so poignant is that I may never see it again. Moreover, I care for the preservation of the landscape because I am aware that even the duration of the natural environment is not guaranteed. Likewise, my devotion to the ones I love is inseparable from the sense that they cannot be taken for granted. . . . Our time together is illuminated by the sense that it will not last forever and we need to take care of one another because our lives are fragile."]],["p","Once we seriously consider the consequences of existence without end, the prospect is not only horrifying but meaningless (as the philosopher Bernard Williams argued years ago). An eternity based on what Louise Glück calls “absence of change” would be not a rescue from anything but an end of everything meaningful. Hägglund puts forth his eloquent case: “Rather than making our dreams come true, it would obliterate who we are. To be invulnerable to grief is not to be consummated; it is to be deprived of the capacity to care. And to rest in peace is not to be fulfilled: It is to be dead.”"],["p","A liberal rabbi or pastor might object that Hägglund is unhelpfully hung up on eternity. Eternity is not at the heart of what such people care about; they hardly ever spend time envisaging it. But Hägglund’s central claim is that a good deal of what passes for religious aspiration is secular aspiration that doesn’t know itself as such. He wants to out religionists as closet secularists. When we ardently hope that the lives of people we love will go on and on, we don’t really want them to be eternal. We simply want those lives to last “for a longer time.” So his reply would probably be: Just admit that your real concerns and values are secular ones, grounded in the frailty, the finitude, and the rescue of ",["em","this life"],". He makes a similar point in relation to Buddhism. He is happy to welcome, as essentially secular, those popular forms of meditation and mindfulness which insist on our being “present in the moment”; but he chides as religious and deluded those doctrinal aspects of Buddhism which insist on detachment, release from anxiety, and an overcoming of worldly desire."],["p","Hägglund is a deconstructionist; his second book, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Atheism-Meridian-Crossing-Aesthetics/dp/0804700788/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Radical+Atheism&qid=1557761386&s=books&sr=1-1"},"Radical Atheism"],"” (2008), was about the work of Jacques Derrida. Put simply, deconstruction proceeds on the assumption that literary texts, like people, have an unconscious that often betrays them: they may say one thing, but they act as if they believe another thing entirely. Their own figures of speech are the slightly bent keys to their unlocking. “This Life” is a work of profound deconstruction. If the religious believer often behaves like an unconscious secularist, then one can assume that some of the great canonical religious texts will do something similar, revealing their actual procedures to a skeptic who is willing to read them against the grain."],["p","Hägglund examines writing by C. S. Lewis, Augustine, and Kierkegaard with a generous captiousness, fair but firmly forensic. He begins with Lewis’s memoir of mourning, “A Grief Observed,” which the Christian writer and apologist wrote after the death of his wife of four years, Joy Davidman. It was a late and unexpected love affair; the book is notable for Lewis’s frank admission of his inconsolable grief, in the course of which he seems to grant that God’s eternal consolation could not be adequate to the loss of ",["em","this"]," particular worldly loved one. Lewis concedes, remarkably, that a religious mother who has lost her son might receive comfort at the level of “the God-aimed, eternal spirit within her,” but not in her earthly and all-consuming role as a mother. “The specifically maternal happiness must be written off,” Lewis allows. “Never, in any place or time, will she have her son on her knees, or bathe him, or tell him a story, or plan for his future, or see her grandchild.”"],["p","Hägglund admires this honesty, and is therefore baffled by Lewis’s account of Davidman’s deathbed words. “She said not to me but to the chaplain, ‘I am at peace with God,’ ” Lewis writes. “She smiled, but not at me. ",["em","Poi si tornò all’eterna fontana"],".” The last line is from Dante’s Paradiso: “Then she turned toward the eternal fountain.” It is the moment at which Beatrice turns away from Dante, whom she loves, toward the everlasting light of God. Eternal beatitude has supplanted human connection. There is no Dante in Beatrice’s beatitude, Hägglund writes, and no Beatrice in Dante’s beatitude. “By analogy,” he observes, “there is no C. S. Lewis for Joy Davidman in heaven and no Joy Davidman for C. S. Lewis.” Lewis loved Davidman as an end in herself, Hägglund thinks, only to exchange that love at the last moment for a love of the eternal, making Davidman a means to an end."],["p","It is the same when Augustine, in the “Confessions,” mourns the loss of a close friend—of a friendship that was “sweet to me beyond all the sweetness of life that I had experienced”—only to remind his readers that, as a good Christian, he should not have loved someone who could be so easily lost, rather than loving God, who can never be lost. It is the same when Martin Luther, grieving the death of his daughter in 1542, reminds his congregation after the funeral that “we Christians ought not to mourn.” And the same when Kierkegaard, in “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Trembling-Penguin-Classics-Soren-Kierkegaard/dp/0140444491/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Fear+and+Trembling&qid=1557761413&s=books&sr=1-1"},"Fear and Trembling"],",” praises Abraham for being ready to sacrifice his son Isaac at God’s command, sure in the knowledge that God will redeem his loss. In all these cases, Hägglund identifies the true dynamic, the true anguish, as secular desire—a natural anxiety about loss, a natural mourning of the lost one—horribly distorted by its corrective religious gloss. The supposed attraction of eternity, Hägglund writes, is that you cannot lose anything there. “But if you can lose nothing in eternity,” he goes on, “it is because there is literally nothing left to lose.”"],["p","The great merit of Hägglund’s book is that he releases atheism from its ancient curse: its sticky intimacy with theism. Hägglund has no need for a parasitical relationship to the host (which, for instance, contaminates the so-called New Atheism), because he’s not interested in disproving the host’s existence. So, instead of being forced into, say, rationalist triumphalism (there is no God, and science is His prophet), he can expand the definition of the secular life so that it incorporates many of the elements traditionally thought of as religious. Hägglund’s argument here is aided by Hegel’s thinking about religion. For Hegel, as Hägglund reads him, a religious institution is really just a community that has come together to ennoble “a governing set of norms—a shared understanding of what counts as good and just.” The object of devotion is thus really the community itself. “God” is just the name we give “the self-legislated communal norms (the principles to which the congregation holds itself),” and “Christ” the name we give the beloved agent who animates these norms."],["p","It’s strange that Hägglund, in a book that moves so easily between Hegel and Marx, doesn’t mention the German philosopher who bridges those two thinkers, and who wrote more lucidly than either about religion: Ludwig Feuerbach. In “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Essence-Christianity-Great-Books-Philosophy/dp/0879755598/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Essence+of+Christianity&qid=1557761433&s=books&sr=1-1"},"The Essence of Christianity"],"” (1841), Feuerbach proposed that when human beings worship God they are simply worshipping what they themselves value, and are projecting those values onto the figment of objectivity they choose to call God. Feuerbach is particularly interesting on the question of immortality. He says that Heaven is the real God of man: it is Heaven we are really after. When Christians say, “If there is no immortality, then there is no God,” they are actually saying, “If ",["em","I"]," am not immortal, then there is no God.” They make God dependent on them. “As man conceives his heaven, so he conceives his God,” Feuerbach writes."],["p","Feuerbach wanted to liberate human beings from their harmful self-deceptions, but Hägglund sees no imperative to disdain this venerable meaning-making projection, no need to close down all the temples and churches and wash them away with a strong dose of Dawkins. Instead, religious practice could be seen as valuable and even cherishable, once it is understood to be a natural human quest for meaning. Everything flows from the double assumption that only finitude makes for ultimate meaning and that most religious values are unconsciously secular. We are meaning-haunted creatures."],["p","That is the theory, at least. I’m not sure Hägglund can quite summon this ideal generosity toward all forms of religious practice. In “Field Flowers,” Glück’s flower scoffs that “absence of change” is humanity’s “poor idea of heaven.” But the religious believer might object that Hägglund’s idea of eternity is equally poor. In fact, his book is in danger of becoming a victim of its own argumentative victories. For if most religionists perform in ways that are unconsciously secular, as he observes, don’t many secularists behave in ways that are unconsciously religious? Doesn’t Chekhov, in the passage I quoted, sound quite religious (“our eternal salvation . . . the higher aims of our existence”)? I suspect that Hägglund would claim this as precisely his point—and as a win for the secular side. He is insistent about the secular importance of enjoying things in themselves and for themselves; treating them as a means to a different end becomes, for him, almost a secondary definition of what is wrong with the religious impulse. But don’t most of us, nonbelievers and believers alike, often substitute one thing for another—which is to say, read the world allegorically? Sometimes a cigar is not just a cigar."],["p","None of these objections disarm Hägglund’s essential argument, which I find—having been raised in a Christian tradition relentlessly committed to preferring the eternal to the worldly—beautifully liberating. But “This Life” is aimed at what he sees as the very foundations of religious appeal; the buildings—the structures housing the exemptions, compromises, and fudges that religious people enact daily—interest him much less.

you could not accuse “This Life” of being merely a work of theory. Hägglund wants to broadcast his good news evangelically—to slide from page to world, from map to journey. The second half of the book, by way of a long and dense reading of Marx, argues that the revaluation of everything we have formerly valued implies not just urgent spiritual redefinition but also political and economic transformation. A hundred pages or more on “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Capital-Abridged-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0199535701/ref=sr_1_12?keywords=Capital+marx&qid=1557761487&s=books&sr=1-12"},"Capital"],",” “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Grundrisse-Foundations-Critique-Political-Classics/dp/0140445757/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Grundrisse&qid=1557761507&s=books&sr=1-1"},"Grundrisse"],",” and the “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Philosophic-Manuscripts-Philosophy-2007-05-25/dp/B01N1XPSBA/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Economic+and+Philosophic+Manuscripts+of+1844&qid=1557761519&s=books&sr=1-2"},"Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844"],"” might at first seem like an extended session of literary-theoretical self-pleasuring. But Marx is at the living center of “This Life,” not just as the slayer of religious and capitalist illusion but, more important, as the utopian who saw beyond merely negative critique. For it’s not enough to claim that religious values can be subsumed by secular ones. One has to lay out new, better secular values. Otherwise, why would religionists ever want to become secularists?"],["p","Savagely compressed, Hägglund’s argument goes something like this: If what makes our lives meaningful is that time ends, then what defines us is what Marx called “an economy of time.” Marx is, in this sense, probably the most secular thinker who ever lived, the one most deeply engaged with the question of what we do with our time. He divided life into what he called the realm of necessity and the realm of freedom. Hägglund adopts these categories: the realm of necessity involves socially necessary labor and the realm of freedom involves socially available free time. Rationally, Hägglund says, we should strive to reduce the realm of necessity and increase the realm of freedom. But capitalism is systemically committed to exploiting most of us, and to steadily increasing the amount of labor at the expense of our freedom. Capitalism treats the means of economic life, labor, as though it were the purpose of life. But, if we are to cherish ",["em","this life"],", we have to treat what we do as an end in itself. “The real measure of value,” Hägglund says, “is not how much work we have done or have to do (quantity of labor time) but how much disposable time we have to pursue and explore what matters to us (quality of free time).”"],["p","Rather than simply replace the realm of necessity with the realm of freedom—which would be impossible anyway, because there is always tedious and burdensome work to be done—we should be able to better “negotiate” the relationship between those realms. Hägglund gives an example of how this might be done when he talks about the way his own work on the book we are reading unites the two realms: writing “This Life” was labor, of course, but it was pursued as an end in itself, as a matter of intellectual inquiry. In a Hägglundian utopia, labor would be part of our freedom. Even drudgery—his example is “participating in the garbage removal in our neighborhood on a weekly basis”—could be an element of our freedom if we see it as part of a collective understanding that we are acting in order to reduce, in the aggregate, socially necessary labor time and to increase socially available free time. This revolution, he says, will require the “revaluation of value” (in Nietzsche’s phrase); and he criticizes a number of thinkers on the left, such as Thomas Piketty and Naomi Klein, for wanting to alter capitalism (via redistribution) rather than effectively abolish it (via a deep redefinition of value). Such people, he says, are stating that capitalism is the problem while also stating that capitalism is the solution."],["p","Hägglund makes himself terribly vulnerable here—to critique, but perhaps also to teasing. The professor of comparative literature is wading into the alien depths of political economy. Worse, his version of democratic socialism proffers a three-point plan, one of whose stipulations is that “the means of production are collectively owned and cannot be used for the sake of profit.” He says that his plan would permit private property, as long as the property could not be “bought and sold for profit.” You could own a house, but only on the basis of “its concrete specificity as valuable ",["em","to"]," you.” Of course, what is valuable to me might also seem valuable to someone else who wanted ",["em","my"]," house. Surely the abolition of the market, of the human tendency to buy and barter, would demand a kind of aggressive, systematic state control that would be at odds with at least some of the freedom (“valuable ",["em","to"]," you”) so dear to Hägglund. An ideal democratic socialism that harmonizes Hägglund’s idea of freedom with the state’s necessarily different idea of freedom will come to America, I guess, not just when the mountain comes to Muhammad but when the tenured academic willingly gives up his Yale chair for a job at New Haven’s Gateway Community College. Like many readers, I get anxious when literary academics use the verb “negotiate” at tricky moments; it forecloses argument, and seldom means actual negotiation. Indeed, Hägglund is unusually weasel-wordy when he concedes that such negotiation will demand “an ongoing democratic conversation.” That’s putting it optimistically."],["p","One could say that, in moving from theory to praxis, Hägglund’s secularity gets a touch religious, burning with correction. And what gets sacrificed, at least on the page, is freedom: in these sections, the reader feels less able to move about within his argumentation and test his propositions, and is instead hemmed in by an atmosphere of political certainty and utopian fervor. One can’t dispel the suspicion that the ideal life Hägglund is envisaging is something like his own—ethically and intellectually satisfying work, pursued as a worthy end in itself, with plenty of freedom and vacation time (though institutionally dependent on a busy, fertile capitalism). To be fair, one could say the same of Camus, when he asserts, in “The Myth of Sisyphus,” that “the absurd man” should try out, in the name of freedom, a variety of roles: the conqueror, the seducer, the actor, and the writer. Camus knew quite a lot about the last three of those roles."],["p","And yet Hägglund’s very vulnerability increases my regard for his project. I admire his boldness, perhaps even his recklessness. And his fundamental secular cry seems ",["em","right:"]," since time is all we have, we must measure its preciousness in units of freedom. Nothing else will do. Once this glorious idea has taken hold, it is very hard to dislodge. Hägglund offers a fulfillment of what Marx meant by “irreligious criticism,” a criticism aimed at both religion and capitalism, because both forms of life obscure what is really going on: that, as Hägglund puts it, “",["em","our own lives"],"—our only lives—are taken away from us when our time is taken from us.” We are familiar with the secular charge that religion is “life-denying.” Hägglund wants to arraign capitalism for a similar asceticism. Religion, you might say, enforces asceticism in the name of the spiritual; capitalism enforces asceticism in the name of the material."],["p","I finished “This Life” in a state of enlightened despair, with clearer vision and cloudier purpose—I was convinced, step by step, of the moral rectitude of Hägglund’s argument even as I struggled to imagine the political system that might institute his desired revaluation of value. As if aware of such faintheartedness, he ends the book with a beautiful examination of Martin Luther King, Jr.—in particular the celebrated last speech he gave, in Memphis. Hägglund reminds us that King had studied Marx with care while a student, and that he told the Montgomery ",["em","Advertiser"],", in 1956, that his favorite philosopher was Hegel. Toward the end of his life, King had begun to insist that society has to “question the capitalistic economy.” He called for what he described as “a revolution of values.” At a tape-recorded staff meeting for the Poor People’s Campaign in January, 1968, King appears to have asked for the recording to be stopped, so that he could talk candidly about the fact that, in the words of a witness, “he didn’t believe capitalism as it was constructed could meet the needs of poor people, and that what we might need to look at was a kind of socialism, but a democratic form of socialism.” King told the group that if anyone made that information public he would deny it."],["p","Hägglund does his usual deconstructive reversal, and argues that King’s religiosity was really a committed secularism. At this point in the book, this looks less like a hermeneutic move than like an expected reality. We read the famous words of King’s last speech with new eyes, alert both to his secularism and to a burgeoning critique of capitalism that had to stay clandestine:"],["blockquote",["p","It’s all right to talk about “streets flowing with milk and honey,” but God has commanded us to be concerned about the slums down here, and his children who can’t eat three square meals a day. It’s all right to talk about the new Jerusalem, but one day, God’s preacher must talk about the new New York, the new Atlanta, the new Philadelphia, the new Los Angeles, the new Memphis, Tennessee. This is what we have to do."]],["p","After the theory and the academic reversals and the grand proposals, Hägglund’s book ends, stirringly, with a grounded account of a man who died trying to use his precious time to change the precious time of oppressed people, aware that the full realization of his vision would likely involve a revaluation of value that could not yet be spoken in America. We still haven’t seen that system, and it’s hard to imagine it, but someone went up the mountain and looked out, and saw the promised land. And that land is in this life, not in another one. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2fa8a35b0bef2942ea80c2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"slug":"books"},{"id":"5c2e1fd54a08312cd3aa6efe","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Atheism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"atheism"},{"id":"5c2e1e8741e4c73c088d7964","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Secularism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"secularism"},{"id":"5c2e1c7722d4972cd5b83289","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Religion","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"religion"},{"id":"5cd2fbc61c97c62efc9a2cc7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Martin Hagglund","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"martin-hagglund"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5c377931890a092c77fb48ba","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c377931890a092c77fb48ba","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Books","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"books"}]}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Books","url":"/tag/books"},{"name":"Atheism","url":"/tag/atheism"},{"name":"Secularism","url":"/tag/secularism"},{"name":"Religion","url":"/tag/religion"},{"name":"Martin Hagglund","url":"/tag/martin-hagglund"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"James Wood","type":"author","title":"James Wood has been a staff writer and book critic at \u003cem>The New Yorker\u003c/em> since 2007.

principally, but not exclusively, to the stark dedication with which it begins and the crushing letter with which it ends, Philippe Besson’s eighteenth book, just published in the United States as “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GNSF4BH/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1"},"Lie with Me"],",” will be received as a mystery of genre. Is it a novel? (That’s what it says on the cover.) Is it autofiction? (The author, after all, is French.) Is it a memoir? (The narrator is a successful writer named Philippe and, like Besson, was born in the drab village of Barbezieux in 1967.) Is it just messing with us? (“Barbezieux doesn’t exist.”) Whatever “Lie with Me” is, it took Besson his whole life to write it, and, when he was done, he thought that he would never be able to write again. The other day, he was sitting in a deserted café near the Pompidou, the site of the book’s most chastely climactic scene, drinking a ",["em","menthe à l’eau"],". He said, simply, “I wanted to write a sadness.”"],["p","He did. An elegiac tale of first, hidden love between two teen-age boys who have no chance of a shared future, “Lie with Me” sold more than a hundred thousand copies in France, where it won several prizes and is being made into a movie. ",["em","Elle"]," deemed it “the French ‘Brokeback Mountain.’ ” The comparison maybe misses the ",["em","forêt"]," for the trees—the book was inspired by Marguerite Duras’s “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0055PGVFS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1"},"The Lover"],"”—but Besson is flattered by it. In 2005, when “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/12/12/new-frontiers"},"Brokeback Mountain"],"” came out, he was in New York. “There was a cinema next to my hotel, so I said to myself, ‘I’ll go see this movie,’ ” he recalled. “I went to the two-o’clock showing that day, and every day for a whole week. And every day I came out devastated. In tears, dazed on the sidewalk! It reminded me of my own story, of the waste—of how we miss a life.”"],["p","Besson decided to write “Lie with Me” in 2016, after an encounter in the same café where we met. The encounter yielded the letter, about neither of which more should be said, lest the plot be spoiled. He realized that all of his other books had been half-conscious efforts to “evoke absence, disappearance, the mourning of love,” and that he’d been spinning around the axis of Thomas Andrieu, a main character in the book and its honoree, for twenty years. After the encounter, Besson went home and wrote the first twenty pages, in a trance of “intimate urgency.” He usually keeps his work to himself until he’s finished, but he sent the beginning to his publisher, with the subject line “",["em","J’arrête ou je continue"],"?” She told him to keep going. “When I finished, it was a terrible moment,” he said. “I didn’t see how I could write novels again. I asked myself, ‘What’s the point, now, of writing a novel?’ ”"],["p","So he wrote a book about the French President, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/emmanuel-macron"},"Emmanuel Macron"],", whom he met in 2014, at a dinner party. (In 2018, Macron appointed Besson to head the French Consulate in Los Angeles, where Besson spends several months a year, but a French court recently voided the nomination.) The book, “",["a",{"href":"https://www.amazon.fr/personnage-roman-Philippe-BESSON/dp/2260030076"},"Un Personnage de Roman"],"” (“A Character from a Novel”), is nominally an insider’s account of the 2017 Presidential race, but—despite a memorable episode in which Macron, new to campaigning, visits a dairy farm without a spare suit to change into—it is an unusually dignified example of the political tell-all. “Really, I wanted to recount the epiphany of a provincial boy who comes to the capital and who emancipates himself from his milieu,” Besson said. One commentator on French television remarked, to Besson’s amusement, that “Lie with Me” and “Un Personnage de Roman” are sort of the same book."],["p",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/molly-ringwald"},"Molly Ringwald"],", the actress and writer, translated “Lie with Me” into English. “I loved his minimalism and how sort of matter-of-fact he was,” she said. “We wanted to make it accessible for Americans, but I didn’t want to lose the Frenchness, because it’s a different voice, and there’s a certain formality to it that I wanted to keep.” And so the book reads like a photograph, faded but composed: the ",["em","bac"],", linden trees, a green Simca 1100, Lino Ventura.

earned his spurs directing and acting in movies of “Henry V” (1989), “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/05/10/too-much-ado"},"Much Ado About Nothing"],"” (1993), “Hamlet” (1996), “Love’s Labour’s Lost” (2000), and “As You Like It” (2006), Kenneth Branagh is at liberty to make of Shakespeare what he will. Had he offered a souped-up “Twelfth Night,” set in the hot-rod capital of Illyria, with Dwayne Johnson as Malvolio and Vin Diesel as Sir Toby Belch, I would have been the first to line up. Instead, Branagh has gone for a quieter option, by giving us “All Is True.”"],["p","The title is a clever thing, i’faith. For a start, it is the alternative title of “Henry VIII,” the play that was being performed at the Globe on June 29, 1613, when a cannon shot, designed to beef up the regal show, set fire to the roof. The entire theatre burned down. (It is surely a cause for regret that this chastening tradition—of major dramatic endeavors being abruptly terminated by too many special effects—has not survived to the present day.) Moreover, to call any movie “All Is True” is a sly provocation, hinting that what follows may not be wholly reliable. Compare the legendary film, set in South America and laced with documentary footage, that was conjured up by Orson Welles in the nineteen-forties but left unfinished. The title? “It’s All True.”"],["p","Branagh’s movie is not, for once, an adaptation of a play. Written by Ben Elton, it’s all about ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/shakespeare"},"Shakespeare"],": not the Maytime of his youth, or the glorious summer of his prime, but his withdrawal—the period after the conflagration at the Globe, when he quit London and went home to Stratford-upon-Avon with his memories, his dirty laundry, and his 401(k). What occurred between his return and his death, in April, 1616, is as open to rash conjecture as every other patch of Shakespeare’s life. We can, with some certainty, attest that he played very little golf with former dentists, but that’s about it. Even the assumption that he stayed put for the rest of his days doesn’t quite bear scrutiny, since a friend reported meeting him in London in November, 1614. The received wisdom, according to the Shakespearean scholar Jonathan Bate, is that “the dramatist ‘retired’ to Stratford, settled down to property dealing, minor litigation, and the life of the complacent country gentleman. This is a myth.” But movies, like history plays, take no pleasure in verification. Why puncture a myth when you can pump it up?"],["p","The part of Shakespeare in “All Is True” is taken by Branagh himself, or by as much of him as can be discerned behind a wig, a false beard, and an even falser nose. How to account for this late-blooming interest in personal camouflage? First came his Hercule Poirot, in “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/murder-on-the-orient-express-and-thelma"},"Murder on the Orient Express"],"” (2017), when it seemed that Birnam Wood had bypassed Dunsinane and parked on Branagh’s upper lip, and now we have his Bard. To make things worse, he is often viewed from the side, allowing us to gauge the precise angle at which the beard, short and sharp, has been glued on. It looks like some sort of digging tool, and, indeed, much of the movie is spent in Shakespeare’s garden. Maybe we are meant to suppose that, ever the innovator, he was the first Englishman to plant sweet damask roses with his chin."],["p","Also resident at New Place, the swell joint that he bought in 1597, are his wife, Anne (Judi Dench), and his daughter Judith (Kathryn Wilder). It has been ungallantly pointed out that, though Anne was William’s senior by eight years, the age gap between Dench and Branagh is almost twenty years wider; on the other hand, no chance to see her on film should be disdained. She finds in Anne the mordant fatigue of someone who has long since resigned herself to being ignored. Weary of her husband’s reputation, she asks, “Have you even once considered mine?,” a jibe that is all the more piquant for being a perfectly scannable, if unwitting, line of Shakespearean verse."],["p","Judith is more blatant in her wrath. Her twin brother, Hamnet, died in 1596, and the movie contends that, whereas he was the apple of his father’s eye, she is regarded—or so she believes—as “a useless, pointless girl.” She and her mother sit and stew in the shadows, bent over their needlework (neither of them can read), and, after one fracas with her father, Judith storms out of the room. You can hardly blame her, given the bondage of the times. “A woman is put upon this earth for one reason,” she exclaims. It is a matter of record that, in 1616, she married a vintner named Thomas Quiney (who really ",["em","was"]," useless, not least at keeping his pants on), and the film shows Shakespeare rising at the wedding feast and assuring his guests that “family is everything.” Ah, yes. Look at the Lears."],["p","The challenge, of course, is to veer off the record in style. “Cursed be he that moves my bones,” we are cautioned by the epitaph on Shakespeare’s tomb, but that has not deterred us from rearranging the skeletal outlines of his life and cladding them in speculative flesh. In “A Room of One’s Own,” Virginia Woolf gives him an imaginary sister, “wonderfully gifted,” who, after being flogged for refusing marriage, escapes to London with dreams of becoming an actor. (They are foiled, and she kills herself.) Germaine Greer, meanwhile, has suggested that Judith became a maidservant in the Quiney household, before marrying Thomas to save his family from scandal. All power to Branagh and Elton, then, as they devise a peculiar plot about Judith and her lost brother, even supplying a whiff of spicy whodunnit. “How did Hamnet die?” his father inquires. For a while, I wondered if Branagh might be morphing back into Poirot."],["p","The problem is not that this film plays fast and loose. Nor that it slides into anachronism, with Shakespeare crowing over “my vast, complex, and spectacularly successful business,” as if he were in shipping or aerospace. At a pinch, I can even take the preëmptive puffery of the script, whereby lesser characters keep lauding his omniscient genius. (Serious bardolatry didn’t get into its stride until the eighteenth century.) No, what’s dismaying about “All Is True” is that it plays so ",["em","slow"]," and loose. The action seizes up. The mood is chronically autumnal. The women suffer under hats the size of fire hydrants. The music is mostly scored for piano and mush. And our attention is drawn, at inordinate length, to landscapes that look too fanciful to be rooted in the real. The falling leaves that swirl around our hero are clearly being driven by somebody just off camera, gunning his leaf blower to the max."],["p","And yet, if you skip the movie, you’ll miss out. For ten minutes, it holds you in its thrall. The occasion is a visit by the Earl of Southampton, to whom Shakespeare, early in his career, dedicated two long poems. He is played by Ian McKellen, who immediately strikes the right balance of gravity and sport. The two men sit by the hearth, warmed by its glow as Falstaff and Shallow were in Welles’s “Chimes at Midnight” (1965). The Earl credits his host with “the finest, the most ",["em","com"],"plete, that most beautiful mind, I’ll warrant, that ever existed in this world” (no one but McKellen would think to stress that syllable), only to gaze upon him and ask, “Why are you such a ",["em","little"]," man?” Talk about lordly. They trade recitations of Sonnet 29—Branagh with a half-angry admission of love, McKellen with amused and flirtatious hauteur. To watch these fine actors, with Shakespeare in their marrow, forgo the toil of modern dialogue for the gracious ease of verse, enfolded in firelight, feels like a privilege. Such an encounter, like most of the events in this movie, probably never took place, but the flame of the words requires no invention. It’s all true."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EWhy%20do%20people%20keep%20making%20films%20about%20writers%3F%20And%20why%20do%20people%20watch%20them%3F%20It%E2%80%99s%20not%20as%20if%20writers%20do%20anything%20of%20interest.%20Unless%20you%E2%80%99re%20Byron%20or%20Stendhal%2C%20a%20successful%20day%20is%20one%20in%20which%20you%20don%E2%80%99t%20fall%20asleep%20with%20your%20head%20on%20the%20space%20bar.%20An%20honest%20film%20about%20a%20writer%20would%20be%20an%20inaction-packed%20six-hour%20trudge%2C%20a%20one-person%20epic%20of%20mooch%20and%20mumblecore%2C%20the%20highlights%20being%20an%20overflowing%20bath%2C%20the%20reheating%20of%20cold%20coffee%2C%20and%20a%20pageant%20of%20aimless%20curses%20that%20are%20melted%20into%20air%2C%20into%20thin%20air.%20As%20Martin%20Amis%20observed%20of%20writers%2C%20in%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Information%2C%E2%80%9D%20his%20winningly%20defeatist%20novel%20of%201995%2C%20%E2%80%9CMost%20alive%20when%20alone%2C%20they%20make%20living%20hard%20to%20do%20for%20those%20around%20them.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAll%20of%20which%20is%20unfair%20to%20J.%C2%A0R.%C2%A0R.%C2%A0Tolkien%2C%20who%20was%20a%20good%20and%20kindly%20man%2C%20with%20friends%20possess%E2%80%99d.%20Much%20of%20the%20time%2C%20nonetheless%2C%20he%20dwelt%20in%20the%20hobbit-hole%20of%20his%20brain%2C%20a%20richly%20furnished%20refuge%2C%20and%20his%20creative%20exertions%2C%20seen%20from%20outside%2C%20entailed%20little%20more%20than%20the%20refilling%20of%20his%20pipe.%20One%20of%20his%20biographers%20claims%20that%2C%20from%201925%20until%20his%20death%2C%20in%201973%2C%20%E2%80%9Cnothing%20really%20happened%2C%E2%80%9D%20so%20it%20makes%20sense%20that%20%E2%80%9CTolkien%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94a%20new%20film%2C%20directed%20by%20Dome%20Karukoski%E2%80%94should%20draw%20us%20back%20to%20his%20earlier%20years.%20Things%20happened%20then.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWe%20find%20Tolkien%20as%20a%20child%20(Harry%20Gilby)%2C%20already%20fatherless%2C%20living%20in%20rural%20bliss%20with%20his%20brother%20and%20mother.%20Paradise%20is%20lost%20when%20they%20move%20to%20the%20murk%20of%20Birmingham%3B%20there%20he%20attends%20a%20formidable%20school%2C%20declaiming%20Chaucer%20by%20heart%20and%20growing%20close%20to%20a%20trio%20of%20like-minded%20students.%20Tolkien%2C%20now%20played%20by%20Nicholas%20Hoult%2C%20lodges%20in%20a%20house%20whose%20d%C3%A9cor%2C%20overstuffed%20and%20precious%2C%20with%20a%20surfeit%20of%20William%20Morris%20wallpapers%2C%20makes%20it%20seem%20like%20a%20cozy%20jungle.%20He%20falls%20in%20love%20with%20Edith%20(Lily%20Collins)%2C%20and%20they%20kiss%20backstage%20during%20a%20performance%20of%20Wagner%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9CRheingold.%E2%80%9D%20(In%20fact%2C%20Tolkien%20scorned%20the%20%E2%80%9CRing%E2%80%9D%20cycle%2C%20as%20he%20did%20any%20attempt%20to%20link%20it%20with%20%E2%80%9C%3Ca%20href%3D%5C%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2001%2F12%2F10%2Fthe-hobbit-habit%5C%22%3EThe%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%3C%2Fa%3E.%E2%80%9D%20In%20his%20judgment%2C%20%E2%80%9CBoth%20rings%20were%20round%2C%20and%20there%20the%20resemblance%20ceased.%E2%80%9D)%20He%20goes%20to%20Oxford%2C%20where%20his%20lambent%20gift%20of%20tongues%20is%20recognized%20and%20encouraged%2C%20and%20then%20to%20war%2C%20where%20everything%20he%20values%20is%20laid%20waste.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20movie%2C%20as%20embarrassed%20by%20religion%20as%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%E2%80%9D%20is%20by%20sex%2C%20averts%20its%20gaze%20from%20the%20Catholic%20faith%20by%20which%20Tolkien%20was%20sustained%3B%20in%20all%20other%20respects%2C%20however%2C%20Karukoski%20is%20determined%20to%20map%20Middle-earth%20onto%20the%20life%20of%20its%20creator.%20Thus%2C%20the%20club%20of%20school%20comrades%20foretells%20the%20brotherhood%20of%20Frodo%20and%20his%20fellow-hobbits%3B%20flamethrowers%2C%20in%20the%20trenches%2C%20turn%20to%20dragons%20in%20Tolkien%E2%80%99s%20fevered%20eyes%3B%20mustard%20gas%20slithers%20and%20drifts%20like%20the%20Ringwraiths.%20The%20question%2C%20though%2C%20is%20not%20whether%20the%20psychobiographical%20dots%20can%20be%20joined%20in%20this%20way%2C%20but%20whether%20they%20ought%20to%20be%3B%20as%20a%20prominent%20Elf%20says%20to%20Frodo%2C%20%E2%80%9CDo%20not%20meddle%20in%20the%20affairs%20of%20Wizards%2C%20for%20they%20are%20subtle%20and%20quick%20to%20anger.%E2%80%9D%20You%20have%20been%20warned.%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","Why do people keep making films about writers? And why do people watch them? It’s not as if writers do anything of interest. Unless you’re Byron or Stendhal, a successful day is one in which you don’t fall asleep with your head on the space bar. An honest film about a writer would be an inaction-packed six-hour trudge, a one-person epic of mooch and mumblecore, the highlights being an overflowing bath, the reheating of cold coffee, and a pageant of aimless curses that are melted into air, into thin air. As Martin Amis observed of writers, in “The Information,” his winningly defeatist novel of 1995, “Most alive when alone, they make living hard to do for those around them.”"],["p","All of which is unfair to J. R. R. Tolkien, who was a good and kindly man, with friends possess’d. Much of the time, nonetheless, he dwelt in the hobbit-hole of his brain, a richly furnished refuge, and his creative exertions, seen from outside, entailed little more than the refilling of his pipe. One of his biographers claims that, from 1925 until his death, in 1973, “nothing really happened,” so it makes sense that “Tolkien”—a new film, directed by Dome Karukoski—should draw us back to his earlier years. Things happened then."],["p","We find Tolkien as a child (Harry Gilby), already fatherless, living in rural bliss with his brother and mother. Paradise is lost when they move to the murk of Birmingham; there he attends a formidable school, declaiming Chaucer by heart and growing close to a trio of like-minded students. Tolkien, now played by Nicholas Hoult, lodges in a house whose décor, overstuffed and precious, with a surfeit of William Morris wallpapers, makes it seem like a cozy jungle. He falls in love with Edith (Lily Collins), and they kiss backstage during a performance of Wagner’s “Rheingold.” (In fact, Tolkien scorned the “Ring” cycle, as he did any attempt to link it with “",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/12/10/the-hobbit-habit"},"The Lord of the Rings"],".” In his judgment, “Both rings were round, and there the resemblance ceased.”) He goes to Oxford, where his lambent gift of tongues is recognized and encouraged, and then to war, where everything he values is laid waste."],["p","The movie, as embarrassed by religion as “The Lord of the Rings” is by sex, averts its gaze from the Catholic faith by which Tolkien was sustained; in all other respects, however, Karukoski is determined to map Middle-earth onto the life of its creator. Thus, the club of school comrades foretells the brotherhood of Frodo and his fellow-hobbits; flamethrowers, in the trenches, turn to dragons in Tolkien’s fevered eyes; mustard gas slithers and drifts like the Ringwraiths. The question, though, is not whether the psychobiographical dots can be joined in this way, but whether they ought to be; as a prominent Elf says to Frodo, “Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.” You have been warned. ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d051f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Movies","parent":[null],"photos":{},"slug":"movies"},{"id":"5c2e1e0b41e4c73c088d792a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Kenneth Branagh","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"kenneth-branagh"},{"id":"5c2e3188425c632c6cd70a09","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"J.R.R.
