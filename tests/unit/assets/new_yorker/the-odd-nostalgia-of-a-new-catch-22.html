data-page="page_1"></span>on Hulu, based on Joseph Heller’s novel, stars Christopher Abbott as John Yossarian, a U.S. Army bombardier whose serial failures to escape the Second World War exemplify the madness of combat, military bureaucracy, and everything else. The fame of the title, of course, has outlived the renown of the book. The catch, as the squadron physician explains to the protagonist, is that, although a flier can be grounded if he is crazy, to announce oneself to be crazy is to demonstrate one’s sanity. The show—which is written by Luke Davies and David Michôd, and has episodes directed by George Clooney, Grant Heslov, and Ellen Kuras—dramatizes this defining paradox, and many subsidiary ironies, with a warm absurdism.</p><p>The six episodes of the series streamline the plot of the novel and straighten out its achronological storyline, with the exception of an early flash-forward to Yossarian’s climactic descent into weirdness. After witnessing the death of an eighteen-year-old making his first sortie, Yossarian emerges naked from his B-25. His blood-streaked body moves down the tarmac as if he has passed through fear and pain into a staggered serenity.</p><p>The story really begins at Santa Ana Army Air Base, where Yossarian attends flight-training school. Clooney plays Scheisskopf, who will be promoted to general before the story is over but begins as Yossarian’s training commander. In this role, Clooney deploys his gifts for lunatic spurting and wild-eyed frothing—the angry clowning familiar from the Coen brothers’ films. Yossarian is having a romance—somewhere between a fling and an indelible reverie—with Scheisskopf’s platinum-blond wife (Julie Ann Emery), who is like the bombshell on the nose cone of the young man’s futile dreams of ease. It’s a bit cloying, the way the golden light graces the bedsheets of their cuckoldry, but the sweetness is of a piece with the show’s M.O.</p><p>Yossarian joins his squadron in the war’s Mediterranean Theatre, where there are German targets to bomb, Italian prostitutes to lose their heads over, and loads of American exceptionalism undergirding the bellicosity of their leader, Colonel Cathcart (Kyle Chandler). Of the men serving alongside Yossarian—a gallery including apple-cheeked optimists, hardened fatalists, thoughtless jingoists, and boys whose disposition we have no chance to learn, because they are immediately destroyed—the most memorable is Milo Minderbinder (Daniel David Stewart). I wish we spent a bit more time exploring the connivances of Milo, as he parlays his position as a mess officer into great status as a war profiteer, but this miniseries already feels at least one episode too long.</p><p>Planes go down. The number of required missions goes up. The level of existential and administrative nonsense remains steady. The adaptation is often rote and merely serviceable. Some scenes are inspired in their brutality, but this “Catch-22” seems, incongruously, to want to inspire its audience. There is an odd sense of romance—a glory beneath the gruesomeness—in its portrait of the paradise that so many of these young men are doomed to lose. The flight scenes have an exhilarating majesty to them that, now and then, evokes the flyboy epics that inspired “Star Wars.” At rest, romping on the beach in swimsuits, the men seem to have emerged from a <em class="">Life</em>-magazine beefcake spread. The color palette, defined by khaki uniforms, brown earth, and the yellow glare of a hard sun, creates a sense that we are watching the whole thing sink into sepia, as if the show were nostalgic for the insanities of yesteryear.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ"><div class="ArticleContributors__bio___3XQjk"><div

based on Joseph Heller’s novel, stars Christopher Abbott as John Yossarian, a U.S. Army bombardier whose serial failures to escape the Second World War exemplify the madness of combat, military bureaucracy, and everything else. The fame of the title, of course, has outlived the renown of the book. The catch, as the squadron physician explains to the protagonist, is that, although a flier can be grounded if he is crazy, to announce oneself to be crazy is to demonstrate one’s sanity. The show—which is written by Luke Davies and David Michôd, and has episodes directed by George Clooney, Grant Heslov, and Ellen Kuras—dramatizes this defining paradox, and many subsidiary ironies, with a warm absurdism."],["p","The six episodes of the series streamline the plot of the novel and straighten out its achronological storyline, with the exception of an early flash-forward to Yossarian’s climactic descent into weirdness. After witnessing the death of an eighteen-year-old making his first sortie, Yossarian emerges naked from his B-25. His blood-streaked body moves down the tarmac as if he has passed through fear and pain into a staggered serenity."],["p","The story really begins at Santa Ana Army Air Base, where Yossarian attends flight-training school. Clooney plays Scheisskopf, who will be promoted to general before the story is over but begins as Yossarian’s training commander. In this role, Clooney deploys his gifts for lunatic spurting and wild-eyed frothing—the angry clowning familiar from the Coen brothers’ films. Yossarian is having a romance—somewhere between a fling and an indelible reverie—with Scheisskopf’s platinum-blond wife (Julie Ann Emery), who is like the bombshell on the nose cone of the young man’s futile dreams of ease. It’s a bit cloying, the way the golden light graces the bedsheets of their cuckoldry, but the sweetness is of a piece with the show’s M.O."],["p","Yossarian joins his squadron in the war’s Mediterranean Theatre, where there are German targets to bomb, Italian prostitutes to lose their heads over, and loads of American exceptionalism undergirding the bellicosity of their leader, Colonel Cathcart (Kyle Chandler). Of the men serving alongside Yossarian—a gallery including apple-cheeked optimists, hardened fatalists, thoughtless jingoists, and boys whose disposition we have no chance to learn, because they are immediately destroyed—the most memorable is Milo Minderbinder (Daniel David Stewart). I wish we spent a bit more time exploring the connivances of Milo, as he parlays his position as a mess officer into great status as a war profiteer, but this miniseries already feels at least one episode too long."],["p","Planes go down. The number of required missions goes up. The level of existential and administrative nonsense remains steady. The adaptation is often rote and merely serviceable. Some scenes are inspired in their brutality, but this “Catch-22” seems, incongruously, to want to inspire its audience. There is an odd sense of romance—a glory beneath the gruesomeness—in its portrait of the paradise that so many of these young men are doomed to lose. The flight scenes have an exhilarating majesty to them that, now and then, evokes the flyboy epics that inspired “Star Wars.” At rest, romping on the beach in swimsuits, the men seem to have emerged from a ",["em","Life"],"-magazine beefcake spread. The color palette, defined by khaki uniforms, brown earth, and the yellow glare of a hard sun, creates a sense that we are watching the whole thing sink into sepia, as if the show were nostalgic for the insanities of yesteryear."]]],"canonicalUrl":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/the-odd-nostalgia-of-a-new-catch-22","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b41c92e2c9b85da1a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b41c92e2c9b85da1a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Television","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"television"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Television","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"television"},{"id":"5c2e1c762396212cbb9fc989","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762396212cbb9fc989","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Reviews","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"reviews"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Reviews","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"reviews"},{"id":"5c2e1eee2396212cbb9fcba0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1eee2396212cbb9fcba0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Second

“Daily Show” correspondent Jordan Klepper embeds himself with various activists and agitators, from environmentalists to immigrants’-rights organizers. Titles that might better express the show’s M.O. and P.O.V. include “How to Be a Good Ally” and “Interrogating My Own Privilege.” Last week’s pilot took Klepper to Texas, where he talked to a group of Iraq War veterans, whose improvised P.T.S.D. therapy involves a modest professional-wrestling league. The show gently placed the veterans’ pile-drivers and power slams in relation to both a broader mental-health crisis and to the V.A.’s systemic failures. When the host asks a grizzled old soldier what actions he, a coddled civilian, could take to “do better,” he was advised to “get off your goddam lazy ass and go see what true veterans live through.”\n\n“Klepper” lays a lot of stress on the idea that its host is “an indoor cat” venturing out of his comfort zone and into the wild for the sake of supporting progressive causes and upholding human decency. It’s an experiment in combining civic engagement and personal growth. When visiting direct-action protesters who are prepared to chain themselves to machines that would bulldoze a bayou, he asks, “Am I cut out for enacting change?” When he goes to Atlanta, where the Georgia Board of Regents has barred undocumented immigrants from enrolling in the state’s public universities, he asks, “What can people like me do to help a situation like this?” Klepper is among nine people arrested for disrupting a Board of Regents meeting; I appreciated the plain sincerity of his commitment less than I admired the space he made for *DACA*{: .small} recipients to tell their own stories, and more than I admired his mentioning, twice, that the jailhouse-booking process involved checking his anus for contraband. “Klepper” isn’t hilarious, and doesn’t intend to be. It succeeds in being funny-ish—in building and diffusing tension with cathartic barbs, self-deprecating jests, and dumb sight gags.\n\nA funny thing happened on the way to Rome burning. In the Trump era, American politics are not amenable to irony of the “Colbert Report” school. (Thus the brief life span of “The Opposition with Jordan Klepper,” which left the Comedy Central lineup in June, after one season of its satirical pro-Trump fulminating and conspiracy-mongering.) The contemporary audience is resistant to leftist sarcasm as a form of home entertainment, and, anyway, you can get that on MSNBC. Instead, we get appeals to conscience and calls to action, phrased as the questing citizen journalism of class clowns made good.\n\n“Klepper” shares its emphasis on grassroots organizing and local action with “Wyatt Cenac’s Problem Areas,” which is now in its second season on HBO. Where “Klepper” tends to be scored to an upbeat fuzz of arena rock, as if it were a woke “Jackass,” “Problem Areas” relies on noodling jazz flute, a gentle sizzle of high hats, and a mellow electric organ, which seem to personify the bubbling thoughts of a socially conscious stoner. That the new season of “Problem Areas” centers on education issues is a useful strategy for containing Cenac’s antic tangents and absurdist discursiveness.\n\nIndeed, the very announcement that the season will focus on education plays as a loopy digression. Cenac began the season with a bit in which he took a soccer ball to the unguarded testicles, as prelude to the observation that “unions are kinda like a cup, in that they protect an employee’s most valuable assets, like fair pay and health coverage,” which in turn brought him around to last year’s teachers’ strike in West Virginia, on which he offered an impressive, thorough view—at once broad and granular—of the issues at stake. Then he announced schools as his running theme and regular topic. Now he is leveraging that theme into an examination of everything else in American life: race, gender, class, money, public health. The tension between the scattered storytelling of “Problem Areas” and the tight focus of its ideas is typical of this emerging genre of humor-inflected advocacy journalism. Here, as on “Klepper,” jokes take the edge off the rage and sand down the square corners of the earnestness. Each deploys a goofy voice for speaking truth to power.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b41c92e2c9b85da1a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b41c92e2c9b85da1a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Television","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"television"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Television","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"television"},{"id":"5c2e1c762396212cbb9fc989","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762396212cbb9fc989","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Reviews","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"reviews"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Reviews","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"reviews"},{"id":"5c2e1e0b41e4c73c088d7929","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1e0b41e4c73c088d7929","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Jordan

Louise (Rosamund Pike) is a medical doctor. Tom (Chris O’Dowd) is an unemployed music critic. Each week, just before their couples-counselling session, they convene at a pleasant pub in an antiseptic corner of Hammersmith, just opposite their therapist’s door. “We are in a permanent marital crisis,” Louise says, at the season’s happy ending.\n\nThe creator, Nick Hornby, and the director, Stephen Frears, have created something that, in its agreeable staginess, looks back seventy years to drama anthologies like “The Philco Television Playhouse” and “Playhouse 90”—golden-age telecasts that put ace writers (Horton Foote, Paddy Chayefsky) to work on good chewy middlebrow scenarios. All of the “action”—Tom’s moving out of the family home, their sparking up the defibrillator paddles of makeup sex—happens offscreen. When Tom and Louise construct narratives of their problems and mess around in the meaning of them, there’s a light touch of Beckett in their double-act repartee. “Have you noticed how we only even seem to be able to talk about the last four seconds?” Louise says. “We start talking, and then somebody says the wrong thing, and then we spend the rest of the time talking about the wrong thing somebody said.” On this verbal surface, ten minutes is plenty of time for a fond frivolous moment, shining with the hope of reconciliation, to collapse like a rotten floorboard.\n\nAn instance of lust precipitated their current crisis. “You slept with someone else, and now here we are,” says Tom. “Except there’s a bit more to it than that, isn’t there?” Louise replies. Yes—a whole constellation of specific and philosophical complaints about sex, love, partnership, and the difficulties of mating for life. “State of the Union” can be a bit self-conscious about its ideas and blatant with its metaphors. Tom—whose cultural references and aesthetic preferences mark him out as a well-curated boy of the “High Fidelity” school—quickly name-checks Kant, later invokes Newton’s laws of motion, and compares their chatter to Bergman’s “Scenes from a Marriage.” The couple argue, ridiculously, when comparing their potential divorce to Brexit. It’s a little labored—but the argument itself, its spirals of talk and Sisyphean seesaws of power, is meaningful in its dynamics.\n\nThis is, clearly, not a Cassavetes psychodrama of visceral anguish and animal revenge. “State of the Union” is more realist than romantic about marriage, but it’s fundamentally optimistic. (One of Tom’s cherished texts is “The Lady Eve,” a classic Preston Sturges comedy of remarriage.) The narrowness of the show helps it wear its drawing-room lightness well, and it is littered with tiny delights. Admire, in the first episode, the aerodynamic way Tom flings his newspaper away when bolting from the therapist’s door in fear. Watch how Louise staggers off from a moment of social embarrassment, as if she had thwacked herself in the head with a cartoon rake. I’d be fascinated to revisit Tom and Louise from time to time, like the subjects of “Seven Up” or “Before Sunrise,” to watch them pick at each other’s onion skins of feeling.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b41c92e2c9b85da1a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Television","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"television"},{"id":"5c2e1c762396212cbb9fc989","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Reviews","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"reviews"},{"id":"5c2e1c8c81ab3335f580f191","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Marriage","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"marriage"}],"sections":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Television","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-television"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a7fb6c4c222f03a82e4a","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Troy Patterson began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2016, and joined the magazine as a staff writer in 2017, covering television and culture.

The color of his trousers was richly nondescript. He wore the clean good sneakers of a cautious wonk working on the weekend. His wire-rimmed Ray-Bans, neither glaringly retro nor conspicuously modish, cut a young-executive profile. A corporate logo on the breast of his synthetic-wool fleece vest suggested that he worked for the limited-liability company developing One Vanderbilt Place, a super-tall skyscraper going up on East Forty-second Street, where it will tower over the row of Madison Avenue men’s stores that are the enduring old corridor of establishment style. This was late-modern capitalist menswear settling into Spring/Summer 2019\\. The fleece was the right weight to meet the cultural weather.\n\n \n\nWhen considering this fleece, we are not considering fashion as expressed in runway looks and streetwear fits, or as worn by trend-piece teens in [Hypebeast tie-dye](https://hypebeast.com/2019/5/mens-best-tie-dye-fashion-spring-2019) and workwear dads in [creative-class chore coats](https://www.gq.com/story/the-best-chore-coats-for-men), their pockets rustling with Pepperidge Farm Goldfish. We are considering the uniform of male corporate power, as practiced by aspirants to its élite levels.\n\n \n\nThis tradition—whose foundation is the business suit—is one that changes at a geological pace, and at the moment its magma is hissing. “The U.S. men’s suit market has shrunk 8% to $1\\.98 billion since 2015,” [the *Wall Street Journal* reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/men-ditch-suits-and-retailers-struggle-to-adapt-11553511602), in March, in a piece that quoted an investment-bank analyst who matches his blazer to his Lululemon stretch pants. Later that month, the top three guys on the management committee of the Goldman Sachs Group devoted their absurdly valuable time to approving a five-sentence e-mail with the subject line “Firmwide Dress Code”; the message alluded to “the changing nature of workplaces generally in favor of a more casual environment” and urged employees to “dress in a manner that is consistent with your clients’ expectations.” In April, Patagonia [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/fashion/patagonia-fleece-fintech-banking.html) that its corporate-sales program would no longer pursue new business in making co-branded fleece tops for big, scary B2B entities like financial firms, say, or super-tall-tower developers. Instead, Patagonia would develop accounts with companies whose environmental and social values reflect its own.\n\n \n\nThe importance of the Patagonia vest is that it is both an evolution of the business-casual costume and a reversion to the waistcoat of the ancient three-piece suit. The fleece vest harmonizes with values that have been invested in the suit since its emergence, in the second half of the seventeenth century. Anne Hollander’s essential book “[Sex and Suits: The Evolution of Modern Dress](https://www.amazon.com/Sex-Suits-Evolution-Modern-Dress/dp/1870626672)” describes the most desirable outfit of the era: an early form of “the coat-waistcoat-and-pants-with-shirt-and-tie scheme,” suggestive “of a changed military ideal and of the enduring conception that men’ s clothes are honest, comfortable and utilitarian, whereas women’ s are difficult, deceptive and foolish.” The fleece—plush but not pretentious, elegant on the molecular level—fits this lineage.\n\n +++inline-recirc\n+++\n\nIn the twentieth century, when money men wore suits all the time, styling matters were much more straightforward. You would simply start your job at Goldman Sachs, and, very soon, a boss would not only tell you to get your hair cut but send you to a particular place to ask for “the Goldman Sachs,” according to the [July, 1990, issue of *Spy*](https://books.google.com/books?id=Tu_Vp4DEqiQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=spy+july+1990&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiiurC3gIDiAhUQZd8KHf-2CcgQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&q&f=false), which retailed “true-life button-down tales of the corporate fashion police state.” The magazine quotes a former Goldman employee: “And at that point, within a week, my identity had been so stripped down by the corporate mentality that I said okay and just went there immediately.” On the surface, Goldman has loosened up since then—it first adopted a business-casual code during the first dot-com boom, in the late nineteen-nineties, when finance bros learned that some tech-sector hot shots would sneer at them for wearing something so “corporate” as a necktie to a meeting.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5cd09f3184305f1e3d7d03b3]||||||\n+++\n\nIn order to dress in a manner consistent with clients’ expectations, finance bros invented—collectively, like a folk ballad—variants of their tribal garb that met the admiration of tech dudes. Suit jackets were relegated to the back of the Aeron. In 2000, during an interview, I chanced getting the journalist Tom Wolfe to crack himself up about confused status-symbolism at a press event celebrating the merger of Time Warner and AOL. Riffing, Wolfe cackled at the awkwardness of the former AOL C.E.O. Steve Case (who looked like a frat pledge wearing his big brother’s navy suit to a nice dinner) and the former Time Warner C.E.O. Gerald Levin (whose tielessness and chinos struck Wolfe as reflecting a mistaken notion of what to wear to breakfast at Il Fornaio Palo Alto). These days, establishment guys pay better attention—money men wear [Allbirds](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/the-optimized-anti-style-of-allbirds-shoes), for example, in obeisance to the tastes of tech guys.\n\n \n\nThe amazing thing about the recent Goldman Sachs memo is that it decrees a standard without stating its terms. In its metaphysical proclamation that “all of us know what is and is not appropriate for the workplace,” the memo bespeaks a Babylonian code of unspoken rules. It says that professional conduct is identical to ruling-class savoir-faire, and its manners are too circumspect to say much else. “This memo should be taught in business schools,” Matt Levine, a former Goldman employee, wrote, in a [Bloomberg opinion column](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-03-06/be-careful-wearing-jeans-at-goldman). “Goldman’s dress code is that you should dress the way you’re supposed to dress at Goldman. If you have to ask, etc. The difference between a middling banker and a great one is this sort of tacit knowledge.” This is the essence of Manhattan business-casual, less a style of dress than an enigmatic language of power. It’s not necessarily exclusive in terms of price, but it’s exclusionary in terms of intent. I suspect that its sensibility trickles down from the acknowledged masters of big-money business-casual clothing: Connecticut hedge-fund guys. They are boastful of their rank. Some years ago, they were early to the trend of double-monk-strap shoes, and they later teased their Manhattan counterparts for continuing to be thus shod after they, the Connecticutters, deemed the double-monk passé.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5cd1924e92eb652e91bb6856]||||||\n+++ \n\nThe untrained eye will catch the system’s drift. Any Goldman Sachs intern will notice that the company’s chairman and C.E.O., David Solomon, is tieless in a portrait on the firm’s Web site, and wearing a shirt of lustrous French blue. The intern will recognize the shirt’s reflection in the many excellent azures adorning the torsos of men entering Goldman’s headquarters this spring. During a sixty-degree springtime lunch hour, you may see these men running out for a fast, casual bite, defenseless, in their shirt sleeves. At Citigroup, on Greenwich Street, the sharp, safe choice for a cool breeze in Q2 is a quilted jacket or vest in aristocratic navy. At any bank, on unfussy fiftysomethings, you see trim black puffers—faded, speaking at once of thrift and expensive ski lifts. The panorama of the scene is a tribute to Ralph Lauren’s prophetic vision: sportswear that’s attached to the traditional garb of monied masculinity by means of it all being stitched together with an invented crest.\n\n \n\nEverywhere there are a lot of vests, and why not? In the preppy tradition, they layer well; in the macho one, they highlight virtuous delts. The vests worn by bosses, as sumptuous as a sober manner will allow, are sometimes so lustrous that they seem carved from mahogany, sometimes so buttery that they seem made from the hides of newborn calves. And they are versatile: on a day off, while walking the dog with your boo in her yoga pants, you can wear a gray Patagonia fleece vest over a blue crewneck sweatshirt, artfully exposing the sweatshirt’s central message, which is that you went to Wharton. The other day, at happy hour at Connolly’s Pub & Restaurant, in midtown, I spotted a navy-blue Vineyard Vines fleece vest over a navy gingham shirt, a navy Nautica fleece vest over a navy gingham shirt, and an anonymous mouse-gray fleece vest over a checked flannel shirt. There was also a dude in a shining Moncler ski vest, as if this were winter in Gstaad, or something, and not sixty-one degrees on Forty-seventh Street. Accidents of costume are essential to the systemic farce.\n\n +++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5cd09fa97bf70b38e5de7450]||||||\n+++\n\nLast week, I warily approached J. Press. I had been a bit embarrassed by a response this shop—“[a default outfitter of the northeastern elite](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/fashion/j-press-preppy-shopping-new-york.html)”—had to the Goldman memo. (“J. Press remains hip to the new order,” a promotional newsletter read. “Our millennials often head over to SoHo House, a three-minute walk from the High Line, where suit and tie is no-no.”) But a visit encouraged a sense of perspective. The shop had just ordered a new print run of “[Rebel Without a Suit: The Not-So-Casual Road to Casual Friday](https://www.amazon.com/Rebel-Without-Suit-Not-So-Casual-Casual/dp/1623061067),” a brief history of the business-casual tradition, by Richard Press and Joseph Cosgriff. The authors’ account ranges from the pivotal “Aloha Fridays” of nineteen-sixties Hawaii to Dockers’s guileful direct appeals to nineteen-nineties H.R. managers and a sartorial correction that followed the 2000 Nasdaq crash, when more than a few large companies rescinded their casual dress codes, even if only temporarily. “Rebel Without a Suit” warns that “whiffing on Casual Friday gives your company another possible reason to fire you, or at least slow down what you once believed to be your meteoric rise to the top of the corporate ranks.” At first I misread that “meteoric” as “meritocratic.” That ominous note sounds like the ring of opening bell on a rag-trade sales day. There is only one rule of business-casual dressing, and it is the rule of fear.\n\n ","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b36cecf40192141d1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Fashion","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fashion"},{"id":"5c2e1dfd2396212cbb9fcb09","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Men’s Fashion","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mens-fashion"},{"id":"5c2e1da541c92e2c9b85db67","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Men’s Clothing","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mens-clothing"},{"id":"5c2e1d2e41e4c73c088d7815","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Businessmen","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"businessmen"},{"id":"5c2e1fa42bfcc72cd92d07bc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Suits","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"suits"},{"id":"5c2e1e352710c62d10815600","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Office Culture","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"office-culture"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef02c14b3c606c102766","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On and Off the Avenue","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-and-off-the-avenue"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a7fb6c4c222f03a82e4a","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Troy Patterson began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2016, and joined the magazine as a staff writer in 2017, covering television and culture.

For every minute of Arya stabbing the Night King, or of Tormund Giantsbane sloshing his wine horn around the Merriment Hall, we have a million years of exquisitely wrought character arcs being shattered into ice cubes and forgotten about, recently deflowered and sobbing in a courtyard, unceremoniously flambéd on the shores of Dragonstone, or vanquished by falling [rubble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FaK4vhLv8). By the end of last night’s episode, the penultimate of the series, we managed to stagger out of that rubble, and might have hoped to gallop off on a white horse and get the hell outta there—to take a bath, regroup, maybe watch a little “Barry.” But only Arya got to do this, and we were left to stew and tweet.\n\nThe “previously on” clips reminded us, via Tyrion at the strategy table, that our objective, going in, was to remove Cersei without destroying King’s Landing. Ha! As the episode begins, Varys, ever the beacon of sanity, is writing a letter containing phrases like “Eddard Stark” and “true heir to the Iron Throne,” his ink glossy and his penmanship exquisite A.F. Who is Varys writing to? The Iron Bank? The Citadel? Whoever’s in Dorne, c/o General Delivery? The Dragonteam is brooding about Dany—she’s holed up, not eating!—but Varys has bigger fish to fry. (The *realm*.) He warns Jon Snow that she’s up to no good: they “both know what she’s about to do,” and it ain’t pretty. This much is obvious, but Jon, of course, is suspicious of *Varys*. Varys tells him that all he’s ever wanted is “the right ruler on the Iron Throne”—I’ve been rewatching the entire series and I can [confirm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLTKPMGEEXw) that he [talks about it constantly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFZen-XO5II)—and that ruler, he says, is Jon. Frankly, Varys, at this point I’m not so sure. “She is my queen,” Jon says, huskily, being an idiot.\n\nAfter a quick, silly conversation with Tyrion in Castle Grayskull’s war room, Dany, annoyed at *everybody* for spreading Jon’s parentage secret around, including Tyrion and Jon, decides that Varys, a betrayer according to Tyrion, must go. Soon enough, our heroes to zeroes are out on the beach, glum, with torches and a grim agenda. Even Drogon seems depressed. Varys says, “Goodbye, old friend,” to Tyrion—generous!—and gets dracarysed. Drogon stalls for a bit, grunting, and I briefly hope he’s run out of accelerant. He hasn’t. So much for the [Targaryen restoration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywkE-x-N9eU).\n\nAfter a Dany-Jon hearthside snuggle-up involving whispers about betrayal—Dany says that Sansa “killed Varys just as much as I did” (hmm; maybe not *quite* as much)—Dany complains that politically, she is less *loved* than *feared*. Huh. Jon says *he* loves her: she will always be his queen! That will fix it.\n\n“Is that all I am to you? Your queen?” she says. No, you are also my aunt, he could respond, and also a real pain in the neck. This show! What once seemed fun is becoming increasingly problematic, like Joe Biden.\n\nTyrion tries to persuade Dany not to burn up King’s Landing, which is as useful as trying to persuade Cersei to not senselessly murder zillions, which he attempted last week. Next, he appeals to Davos Seaworth, oniony hero. “You’re the greatest smuggler alive, aren’t you?” he asks. My hope is that Varys has escaped through a trapdoor in the sand, the way Margaret Hamilton elevatored her way out of the Wicked Witch’s various [smoke](https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/07/22/margaret-hamilton-the-wicked-witch-of-the-west-suffered-3rd-degree-burns-while-making-the-wizard-of-oz/), [fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leb83bRkXDg), and [melting situations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7GJcKuVGm8), and that he’ll get smuggled to Essos, to command that herd of war elephants we’d heard so much about. No such luck. Tyrion wants to smuggle Lannisters, of all things.\n\nIn King’s Landing comes the destruction we’ve been expecting: part unholy “[Mission Accomplished](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/04/14/trumps-mission-accomplished-tweet-and-the-premature-declaration-that-haunted-bush/?utm_term=.0cd68443af8d),” part “[That was some weird shit](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/george-w-bush-donald-trump).” It begins charmingly enough: Arya and the Hound arrive, full of moxie and big dreams. “I’m Arya Stark,” Arya tells a soldier. “I’m here to kill Queen Cersei.” *Hmm*, he seems to say. I need to talk to my supervisor.\n\nIn a tent, Jaime and Tyrion have a touching who-knows-what-tomorrow-brings talk that recalls similar conversations in Season 4, when Tyrion was charged with murder and Jaime, stealthy mensch, was his only relative who didn’t want him dead. “If not for you, I never would have survived my childhood,” Tyrion tells him now. “You were the only one who didn’t treat me like a monster.” Tyrion tries to get him to agree to take Cersei to an escape dinghy he’s cooked up with Davos—a dinghy whose emptiness, we know, will break his heart. (Tyrion seems uncharacteristically naïve this season.) Jaime says he supposes he’ll die soon. On the upside: “Escape.” Yikes. There’s much talk of bells ringing, which will mean that the city has surrendered; for us, this can only mean that we will hear some bells, and that they will toll for mayhem.\n\nAction! Euron, on one of his stupid ships, greases up a Qyburn murder machine. Archers scoot around the castle ramparts; townsfolk take cover; Arya and the Hound and Jaime bop along all innocent-like. (He’s put a glove over his magic gold-plated hand, for anonymity.) The armies stare at each other, dead-eyed, as Cersei surveys the field from her imperial glower station. At sea, Euron sees a dragon overhead and starts shooting. Might I suggest using *fire* this week, Dany, in addition to just flying straight at your assailant? She does, and it’s delicious. I may be sick of Dany, but I am not sick of her dragon burning up Euron’s attempts at victory.\n\nIn the quiet battlefields, sounds of distant fireballs; an explosion inside castle walls; a dragon overhead. The Unsullied attack, and we cut between several kinds of mayhem: horseback, dragon-burning-city, immolation of innocents, calm tyrannical rule from on high. Tyrion ambles placidly [through the noise and waste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggIQpmUhu10). Cersei tells Qyburn that the Red Keep won’t fall, but he’s not so sure, your grace. Jaime scurries through various alleyways and runs valiantly Cersei-ward, making me sigh like Jon Snow. Drogon lands on a turret and caws, flummoxing the masses. Soldiers drop their swords in surrender. Jon exhales soulfully. The bells, people cry. [Rock the bells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyswjkZJugI)!\n\nThe bell-ringing: Cersei does not like it. Dany, floating on Drogon, a bit of ash on her cheeks, like the chimney sweeps in “Mary Poppins,” doesn’t, either. She’s got a rampage to continue! Tyrion looks up at her, thinking, Ah! Maybe *this* is what Varys was talking about? Dany and Drogon [torch the city](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-screening-room-fire-in-cardboard-city), buildings and people alike, and Jon wonders, Maybe my Queen didn’t hear the bell? Hey, Aunt Daenerys! As the fighting resumes, brutally, Cersei looks out her window, like, I shall stand here calmly looking regal, if slightly wide-eyed, as this dragon fucks up my town, just as I did [when I blew up the Great Sept of Baelor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6oO4p9ghfo) and my boy-king son tipped gracefully out a window to his death. [Dignity: always dignity](https://vimeo.com/7667259).\n\nJaime makes his way to the landing, to check for the dinghy, but Euron is lurking about in the water, being irritating. After some banter on the beach—“I fucked the Queen!” Euron cackles—the world’s last remaining Cersei enthusiasts begin fighting, quite stabbily; Euron wants to be “the man who killed Jaime Lannister.” He gets close: both men skewer each other, though Jaime walks away alive. (I’m going to see about Qyburn making him a gold ribcage.) Euron, annoying to his last breath, smirks at a blue sky.\n\nInside, the Hound and Arya have landed on Cersei’s hilarious floor map. But now the Hound, looking up at a dragon through collapsing castle walls, is feeling protective of his mentee. You want revenge? he says. ([Well, revenge *costs*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtgmnhRQir4).) You come with me, you die here, he tells her. It gives her something to think about as he heads off to murder his brother. “Sandor,” she says. *Aww!* His *name!* “Thank you.” Off she scoots.\n\nAs the castle crumbles, the Hound finds the Wine Queen and her creeps—Qyburn, Mt. Clegane—in what may be the most exciting staircase encounter since [Season 3 of “Grantchester.”](https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/801561/Grantchester-season-3-James-Norton-sex-scene-vicar-Sidney-Chambers-Amanda-ITV) But it turns out to be gross and unsatisfying. Qyburn unceremoniously dies, via the Mountain’s crushing his head. The deaths of intelligent, rational people on this show—your Tywins, your Qyburns, your Varyses—create a special pain: even if they’re scumbags, you’ll miss their competence.\n\nCersei, sensing more head-crushings to come, politely takes her leave as the Clegane brothers begin their staring contest. She ends up on her floor map, crying alone—but guess who shows up in a dimly lit corner, fresh off some Euron-slaying. At long last, Cersei shows Jaime some kindness, and a bit of g.d. gratitude. “You’re bleeding,” she says. But we have found narrative cohesion, my love.\n\nBack on the staircase, the Mountain removes his sanity-preserving (our sanity) Vader helmet. (Out in the streets, Arya, also helmetless—the Starks’ hair seems to spare them from all manner of [head discomfort](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/watching/daenerys-kit-harington-game-of-thrones.html), except decapitation—tries to protect some townspeople.) The Mountain does his patented Oberyn Martell eyeball maneuver—the old poke-n-squish—but the Hound stabs him through the head, at which point the Mountain *somehow* *extracts the sword that has been run through his head.* The Hound is like, Oh, come *on*, how am I even *seeing* this? Not just because it’s *impossible* but also because my eyes should be rattling around in my neck somewhere! He shoves the Mountain off the crumbling tower, and both of them plummet into a raging fire. So they should be gone for a minute or two.\n\nI’ll say this: things have livened up in King’s Landing. I’m glad that Cersei dealt with some dust, grime, blood, and emotions beyond peevishness. I was hoping for a niftier dénouement for Cersei and Jaime: maybe a “Hang on—*Euron*? I can’t *believe* you fucked that guy!” and a “Wait—are you even really pregnant?” before Arya showed up to murder Cersei, possibly wearing Joffrey’s face, or Tommen’s, or any number of Freys—I’m not fussy—leaving Jaime intact. But no: Arya has chosen altruism over revenge, and possibly getting crushed by rocks. Pff. Inside the darkened castle, Cersei and Jaime are alone. “Nothing else matters,” he says. “Only us.” “The Rains of Castamere” plays amid increasing amounts of dragonrubble, and our attractive incest-lovers—one set, anyway—disappear in a cloud of dust and darkness.\n\nOutside, it’s quiet like nuclear winter, and snowing particles. Arya has survived, but she looks like Alice Cooper. (Blood, ash, bad vibes: [welcome to my nightmare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgPqZmrJ380).) She stares at various fires and charred lumps—but lo, a white horse! ([Equus ex machina](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-4-recap-sex-lies-and-hellfire)?) Maybe she’s dead and this is a Westerosian “[What Dreams May Come](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPZpQsEFcKI).” Maybe all of us are. She gallops through the smoldering ruins, leaving us behind, frowning. Next week: the Queen of the Ashes is startled to find that the Iron Throne has melted, and Bran goes on one last warg.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1fa3397f5b30646d08b0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1fa3397f5b30646d08b0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Game of Thrones Recap","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"game-of-thrones-recap"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Game of Thrones Recap","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"game-of-thrones-recap"},{"id":"5c2e1e8836cecf40192143c7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1e8836cecf40192143c7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"“Game of Thrones”","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"game-of-thrones"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"“Game of Thrones”","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"game-of-thrones"}],"sections":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Television","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-television"},{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"On Television","parent":[{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"on-television"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"590a04521c7a8e33fb390c11","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sarah Larson is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

I’d hoped that the episode after “[The Battle of Winterfell](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-3-recap-the-stab-heard-round-the-world)” and its shattering of zombies would begin with “[Ding, Dong, the Witch Is Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHQLQ1Rc_Js)” joy. Instead, it began funereally, then segued to revelry, then to fireside unbuttoning, and ended not only with horror but with broken hearts across the realm. Tell the old gods and the new that I’d like to register some complaints.\n\n As the episode begins, Winterfell mourns the fallen, especially the Mormonts, Beric Dondarrion, and Archie Andrews—forgive me, that’s Theon, looking very “Riverdale” in death. Jon bellows a eulogy; torches in hand, he and Dany share a look that says, Look, our relationship is fucked, but right now we’ve got some pyres to light. The conflagration is gigundo; to her credit, Dany does not show off by wading into it and surviving. But she makes a scene in the mead hall, where the celebrations have begun, and where Gendry is looking around for his boo. As he walks by, Dany announces his parentage—with a vaguely threatening How *dare* you be the son of Robert Baratheon? vibe—and then makes him the lord of the Baratheon stronghold. Bastard no more! Davos Seaworth yells, “To Lord Gendry Baratheon, of Storm’s End!” (Later, he grouses amusingly to Tyrion about the mysterious Lord of Light: “We fight his war and win, and then he fucks off.” What did he *want*? I love Davos. I may see about ordering an onion-sigil flag.)\n\nElsewhere in the hall, Brienne puts her hand over her goblet—none for me, thanks—and Jaime removes it. These two have a lot of [hand stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFC9rcwnLow). “We fought dead things and lived to talk about it,” Jaime says, using the oldest line in the book. “If this isn’t the time to drink, when is?” Bran is partying Bran-style, by quietly sitting away from the crowd, saying things like “I don’t really *want* anymore.” Dany makes a toast to “Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!”—it’s about damn time! Tormund, after insisting that vomiting *is* celebrating, drunkenly praises Jon while sloshing a wine-filled ram horn, and Dany watches with jealousy. Mind-bending music plays, implying that she’s [freaking out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPflEZG4US8) that these happy fools won’t bend the knee, and, possibly, that she wants to murder everybody. Thankfully, Varys peers at her suspiciously.\n\nTyrion’s drinking game—a proto-“I Never”—returns, swiftly revealing that Brienne is a virgin. She leaves, and Jaime follows; Tormund is randily heartbroken. But, as in [John Hughes movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QUnSTxFZfw), the lovable sidekicks (Pod, Tormund, and, nearly, the Hound) pair off with various deus ex sexinas. Sansa approaches the Hound for a chat; she’s been sharing meaningful moments with weathered old souls in each episode. He tells her that he could have saved her from Ramsay and Littlefinger if she’d left King’s Landing with him. “Without Littlefinger and Ramsay and the rest, I would have stayed a Little Bird all my life,” she says. Few women would serenely credit their personal growth to a manipulative whoremonger and a sadistic rapist; I might have written the line differently—and, while I’m revising, all that rape.\n\nGendry finally finds Arya, who’s practicing her archery—“I *am* celebrating!”—and tells her his news. “I’m not Gendry Rivers anymore,” he says. He kisses her, kneels, declares his love, proposes. She is affectionate, but says, “[That’s not me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cve-FeN9etg).” Respect, Arya, but oof! Just figure out something *unconventional*, you guys. Gendry looks sad, I look sad, and Arya keeps shooting her arrows. (In Seasons 1 and 2, they’re awfully cute together, despite the fact that she looks about eight. Still, age-wise, they’re less creepy than, say, Emma Woodhouse and Mr. Knightley—and there’s a lot of *valor* between them.)\n\nSpeaking of which, Jaime knocks on Brienne’s door. I’m fainting in all directions. He seems curious about this virginity situation; I’m afraid to watch. I’m anxious about how Brienne’s wide-eyed awkwardness might interact with Jaime’s hard-won personal decency. They begin with flummoxed hearthside blouse-unbuttoning, followed by an abrupt shark-faced makeout. I’m rattled, but rooting for them.\n\nIn their own fraught boudoir, Jon and Dany talk of Jorah Mormont, and of love; they kiss but then seem to remember they’re related, *and* that she’s paranoid about the Iron Throne. Dany attempts to make Jon swear to secrecy about his parentage; his squinty eyes are uncomprehending. But Dany—his *word!* How can he betray it? “You are my queen,” he says. “And they are my family. We can live together.” Sure. “We can,” she says. “I’ve just told you how.” Varys and I agree: she might need to be murdered.\n\nIn the war room, tensions are high around the table map. How to destroy Cersei but not all of King’s Landing? Jon wears a pained expression, which, at this point, might just be his face. However they do it, Sansa would like to allow her exhausted armies to rest for a goddam minute first. Dany furiously rebuffs this idea; Jon says they’ll do what Dany wants. Jon is quickly becoming a jive turkey. Er, Jon—a word?, his sisters say. At the weirwood tree, with Bran tagging along, Sansa and Arya respectfully remind Jon that they don’t trust Dany, and that the four of them are “the last of the Starks.” There’s a pregnant pause, like Jon’s got some familial statements to make.\n\n“It’s your choice,” Bran pipes up. It’s fun having an all-knowing sibling to goad you from the sidelines. Jon swears them to secrecy, pre-bean-spilling; Sansa scoffs. Then he makes *Bran* tell them his news—and the scene ends! We don’t even get to see Arya and Sansa learn that Jon is their cousin, and that their father wasn’t a cheater, or that their poor mother was made to suffer for a lie. I would have happily surrendered several minutes of staring between Cersei and Tyrion—a stare-off that occurs later in the episode—to see this revelatory moment get its due.\n\nAs the armies head to King’s Landing to knock Cersei off the Iron Throne, Jaime will hang back, avoiding a conflict-of-interest scenario, and Brienne will stay, too, to protect. I’m into this—it reminds me of the end of “The Big Chill,” when the two nutty ones decide to stay upstate together for a while and just see what happens. “I’m happy that you’re happy,” Tyrion says to his brother. “I’m happy that you finally have to climb for it.” He’s excited to make tall jokes. Their conversation is interrupted when Bronn comes in with the ol’ crossbow and cheerfully calls them a pair of gold-plated cunts. He wants money from some Lannister, at some point. Hang on: Hasn’t he heard their motto?\n\nArya and the Hound have a moody conversation on horseback, each wandering lonely as a cloud and dreaming of vengeance; Sansa watches dragons fly as Tyrion asks why she’s determined to “dislike” Dany. I’m annoyed: it’s not a catfight, pal. Worse, four sane and lovable characters are bidding farewell: Tormund heads north, after telling Jon, “You weigh as much as two fleas fucking”; Jon tells him to take Ghost (!); and Sam and Gilly—*nooooooo!*—say goodbye, too. Gilly is pregnant, and Sam starts explaining why. “I’m sure he knows how it happens, Sam,” Gilly says. I’ll miss them all, and am hoping that they swoop in later, with northern wild men, canine teeth bared, or bookish suggestions to save these loons from themselves.\n\nAt this point, the episode takes a nosedive, and that nosedive’s name is Euron Greyjoy. As usual, he’s leading a fleet of ships, waiting to ambush his enemies. Leading the opposing fleet, Grey Worm and Missandei, holding hands, smiling, and looking gorgeous, enjoy their last happy moments on this godforsaken television program. Euron, the Wile E. Coyote to Qyburn’s Acme, has a deck-mounted arrow-shooting machine, which he shoots at Rhaegal, who cries out in agony and falls into the sea. At first, I thought this was a dream sequence. It wasn’t! Dany, in a rage, bears down on Euron, but, mysteriously, chooses to dodge arrows and yowl instead of Dracarysing his face off. Next, Euron shoots up our heroes’ ship. After a startling shot of underwater Dinklage, the gang washes ashore (even Varys, sputtering), sans Missandei. Cersei has her. She’s also convinced the too-eager-at-all-times Euron that she’s pregnant with *his* baby.\n\nAfter learning that things are hitting the fan in King’s Landing—what did he think was going to happen?—Jaime leaves his fur-blanketed bedchamber and saddles up his horse. Brienne races after him. “You’re a good man and you can’t save her,” she says. He disagrees—“She’s hateful and so am I.” He gallops off; she weeps; I glower. Maybe I’ll start writing fan fiction, in which these people are true to their best selves.\n\nIn the final, horrible scene, a face-off: the Grey Worm-and-Dany brigade versus Cersei and a castle of jerks. They’ve got Missandei front and center on the ramparts and Mount Clegane nearby. Cersei has [her wine-goblet smirk](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-appearances/an-art-historical-analysis-of-cersei-lannister-sipping-wine) but no wine goblet. Tyrion approaches the castle, gazing up at Cersei and her elaborate shoulder armor. “I know you don’t care about your people,” he begins, off to a good start. “They hate you and you hate them.” Then he tries to appeal to—get this—Cersei’s love of children. It does not work. Missandei’s last word, bless her, is “Dracarys.” *Somebody* had to say it. Next week: hellfire, and a possible Queen of the Ashes.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e8836cecf40192143c7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"“Game of Thrones”","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"game-of-thrones"},{"id":"5c2e1fa3425c632c6cd70841","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"TV Recaps","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tv-recaps"}],"sections":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Television","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-television"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a04521c7a8e33fb390c11","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sarah Larson is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

We’d have to lose a bunch, logic went, some painful. Theon, some of us reasoned, would be fine to give up. He had a rough life, a grim groin situation, redemption, and a tender bowl of soup with Sansa. Some felt they could sacrifice Grey Worm or Davos Seaworth, as long as they could keep Brienne or Tormund. It was all quite ghoulish and weird, just as “Game of Thrones” has encouraged us to become: the grunting ice zombies to its Night King. But in the end we did O.K.—no dead Lannisters or Starks or Briennes of Tarth. It was a bloodbath ending in ice chips, and we emerged feeling good.\n\nAs the episode begins, in the quiet predawn hours at Winterfell, dread is all around: [black skies, black hearts, might lose](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/29/17174194/friday-night-lights-clear-eyes-full-hearts-jason-katims). Grey Worm dons his creepy helmet, Bran gets rolled out to the godswood, I frantically adjust the lighting in my living room. The lights are off in Westeros, and there’s nothing I can do in New York to improve it. I turn off everything but a pink L.E.D. plant bulb, like a weed enthusiast trying to establish a mood.\n\nAs the phalanxes stand stock still, looking tough, who should saunter up on horseback but the ninety-per-cent tedious and ten-per-cent fantastic Melisandre of Asshai, spooky wielder of fire magic? She has Jorah tell the Dothraki army to lift their swords, then says a little High Valyrian hocus-pocus, and blammo—the army’s swords burst thrillingly aflame, à la Beric Dondarrion’s. I despise battle episodes, but the panning shot of those swords lighting up in the darkness is glorious. The firesword maneuver, by my count, is the second acceptable thing Melisandre has done on this show, and I salute her for it.\n\nI’ll spare you the details of the entire battle. Suffice it to say that it begins with subtitles that read “Unsullied grunt” and “wights snarling,” and my frantically eating clementines, which is all I can contribute to the war effort. *Charge!* As Dany and Jon rev up the dragons, bringing the dracarys fireballs, great clouds of snow and ash fly around. Visibility-wise, we go from [Mr. Magoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uz3I77MB-c) to Mr. Magoo in a snowstorm.\n\nThe episode helpfully cuts between the battlefield, the dragon skies, the crypt—where mothers, children, the elderly, and able-bodied adults huddle in fear and mild embarrassment—the godswood, and the ramparts, so we can worry about [every battle, everywhere, always, in our mind](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/game-of-thrones-returns-for-season-7). The dragonfire is beautiful; the tree zone is quietish. In a fight, Edd saves Sam Tarly, then Edd dies: his watch has ended. In the crypt, Tyrion swigs from a flask; in the sky, Jon and Dany fly through what appears to be the ash cloud above [Eyjafjallajökull](https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/icelands-ashes). The soldiers rush into the castle as wights advance, and Melisandre, fire pal, magically lights the trenches—boy, she is great, I’ve decided.\n\nThe clever conversationalists of Winterfell, inevitably, are of crypt constitution. Varys, sage and camp as death yowls ever closer, says, “At least we’re already in a crypt.” Tyrion, not wanting to join the army of the dead, says, “I can think of no organization less suited to my talents.”  “Witty remarks won’t make a difference,” Sansa says. “That’s why we’re down here. None of us can do anything.” The most heroic thing they can do is “look the truth in the face.” She and Tyrion reminisce, somewhat fondly, about their improbable but not-so-bad marriage. These two have both matured. I can relate to these crypt-dwellers somehow, chatty and powerless in a world of snarling musclemen.\n\nIn the godswood, as Theon tries delivering a heartfelt speech, Bran gives him the same line he gave Jaime: Hey, man, everything you did brought you to where you are now. (In the seventies, we expressed this by singing “[Circle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yjxWfyxpqY)” around a campfire.) That settled, Bran takes off, in his own special way. “I’m going to go now,” he says, and wargs wargward, with [Little Orphan Annie eyeballs](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Little-Orphan-Annie-1/dp/1600101402). “Go where?” Theon says, uselessly, to ravens, crowing, fire, atmosphere. This is an episode with a surfeit of *atmosphere*. It reminds me of a Lillian Hellman revival I went to that was mostly stage fog.\n\nInto this vibe walks the Night King, [Snoozefest of Doom](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/an-open-letter-to-the-white-walker-army). As his wights terrifyingly breach the Winterfell fire wall, I breach the lid of a can of Pringles—clementines can’t save me now. “Archers on top!” Jaime yells. Gendry [fights with a wight, rampartly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBShN8qT4lk); Arya ninjas it up with her double-ended stabbo. The Hound, depressed, gives up—and he’s probably not *thrilled* about all this fire—and Beric is annoyed. “You can’t fight death!” the Hound grouses.\n\n“Tell *her* that!” Beric says, pointing to Arya, who’s scrabbling around and fighting like hell, as is young Lyanna Mormont, late-series fan favorite. Lyanna sees a repulsive giant, like a blue-eyed Wun-Wun with zero good qualities, or possibly the thing that Tormund killed in his youth, and she runs at it, screaming wonderfully, with a hatchet. I love this girl. He picks her up, grody King Kong to her Fay Wray. As he tries to crush her, I realize I’m actually crying—even more so as she hollers again and hatchets him in the eye, [zombie-kill](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/podcast-dept/dirty-john-looks-and-tv-adaptations-can-be-deceiving) style. They fall—oof!—and die. She reminds me of the end of “Carmen”: a gorgeous moment of bravery in the face of end-of-life unpleasantness.\n\nAfter a bunch of wight hooey with Arya in a library, and continuing anxiety in the crypt, valor, in the form of saving Arya from a wight pack, takes Beric Dondarrion. Arya and Melisandre mourn him in a cozy alcove. “The Lord brought him back for a purpose,” Melisandre says. “Now that purpose has been served.”\n\n“I know you,” Arya tells Melisandre. She doesn’t mention that she was *just* talking about her, in a leeches-and-virginity-focussed seduction ploy. “You said I’d shut many eyes forever.”\n\n“[Brown eyes, green eyes, and blue eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxDv_RTdLQo),” Melisandre says. “What do we say to the god of death?”\n\n“[Not today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Bz59sxCxcE),” Arya whispers, and charges off. Attagirl!  \n\nAt the godswood, Theon is raring to go, arrows aflame. Outside the walls, there’s a little fakeout: Dany blasts the Night King with dragonfire, but he lives, and smirkingly. Conveniently, the Night King is a drama queen: he turns slowly, he struts slowly, he lifts his arms to raise the army of the dead slowly. As with a Bond villain, preciously deployed theatrics give the good guys time to catch up. As the freshly killed of Winterfell come zombie-ing alive—poor Lyanna Mormont’s eyes open, that eerie blue, and the cellos match our woe—things are looking bad all over. Viserion crashes through a Winterfell wall, closing in on Jon with blue fire. Drogon is injured and Dany fends for herself; as a wight descends, faithful Jorah chops its head off. He and Dany fight side by side and do some damage; it’s fun to see Dany actually wield a sword, after all her tough talk. In the crypt, Tyrion kisses Sansa’s hand tenderly. My emotions return. I’m going to miss all these guys someday soon.\n\nIn the godswood, Theon has somehow fought off a legion of wights and is breathing a sigh of relief—now I just have to fight the Night King, he thinks. As the Night King appears, Bran wakes up, removes his “Back in Fifteen Minutes” sign—where the hell *was* he?—and tells Theon he’s a “good man,” thanking him. Theon gets teary. Maybe Bran went to etiquette camp on his little journey.\n\nWith the raging glory of a give-’em-hell Lyanna Mormont, Theon charges the Night King full force, but the Night King quickly runs him through with his spear—it’s a swift, sad, definitive, Rickon Stark-like death. Goodbye, dear Theon. You had a good arc. May your penis return to you in the afterlife.\n\nThe Night King approaches our raven-boy hero, to a few plaintive piano notes. With the calm of a tai-chi master, he begins to unsheathe his backpack sword. And who should come *flying through the air*—I understand neither the logistics nor the “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” physics of this, and frankly I don’t care—but *Arya effing Stark*, screaming like a warrior, Valyrian-steel dagger in hand. The Night King turns and grabs her, midair; she stabs him in the chest—with the *same dagger that was used in an attempt to kill Bran in Season 1!*—and causes him to explode into a bunch of deliriously wonderful ice cubes, his whole horrible army following suit: White Walkers, undead dragon, wights, *all* those motherfuckers. I growl-scream with such joyful force that my neighbors may dial 911, or at least 311\\. A thousand C.G.I. ice monsters go boom, and somehow it has brought me great joy. The living have vanquished the dead, and I have become a fantasy enthusiast.\n\nThat Jorah Mormont dies seems, to me, like a small price to pay. But Dany, reasonably, weeps for him, evincing not only human emotion but the willingness to get blood on her beautiful white coat. It’s touching, but I’m distracted by thoughts of Arya, and of how Gendry might react to all this. Melisandre, declaring that her work here is done, removes her magical necklace and wanders off to die on a snowy moor. Goodbye, you mysterious creature beyond my ken. Next week: monster cleanup; crypt expansion; a ticker-tape parade; cheering in a mead hall; and war among humans, just like the good old days. Onward and upward with the Starks!","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e8836cecf40192143c7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"“Game of Thrones”","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"game-of-thrones"}],"sections":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Television","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-television"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a04521c7a8e33fb390c11","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sarah Larson is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

Louise (Rosamund Pike) is a medical doctor. Tom (Chris O’Dowd) is an unemployed music critic. Each week, just before their couples-counselling session, they convene at a pleasant pub in an antiseptic corner of Hammersmith, just opposite their therapist’s door. “We are in a permanent marital crisis,” Louise says, at the season’s happy ending.\n\nThe creator, Nick Hornby, and the director, Stephen Frears, have created something that, in its agreeable staginess, looks back seventy years to drama anthologies like “The Philco Television Playhouse” and “Playhouse 90”—golden-age telecasts that put ace writers (Horton Foote, Paddy Chayefsky) to work on good chewy middlebrow scenarios. All of the “action”—Tom’s moving out of the family home, their sparking up the defibrillator paddles of makeup sex—happens offscreen. When Tom and Louise construct narratives of their problems and mess around in the meaning of them, there’s a light touch of Beckett in their double-act repartee. “Have you noticed how we only even seem to be able to talk about the last four seconds?” Louise says. “We start talking, and then somebody says the wrong thing, and then we spend the rest of the time talking about the wrong thing somebody said.” On this verbal surface, ten minutes is plenty of time for a fond frivolous moment, shining with the hope of reconciliation, to collapse like a rotten floorboard.\n\nAn instance of lust precipitated their current crisis. “You slept with someone else, and now here we are,” says Tom. “Except there’s a bit more to it than that, isn’t there?” Louise replies. Yes—a whole constellation of specific and philosophical complaints about sex, love, partnership, and the difficulties of mating for life. “State of the Union” can be a bit self-conscious about its ideas and blatant with its metaphors. Tom—whose cultural references and aesthetic preferences mark him out as a well-curated boy of the “High Fidelity” school—quickly name-checks Kant, later invokes Newton’s laws of motion, and compares their chatter to Bergman’s “Scenes from a Marriage.” The couple argue, ridiculously, when comparing their potential divorce to Brexit. It’s a little labored—but the argument itself, its spirals of talk and Sisyphean seesaws of power, is meaningful in its dynamics.\n\nThis is, clearly, not a Cassavetes psychodrama of visceral anguish and animal revenge. “State of the Union” is more realist than romantic about marriage, but it’s fundamentally optimistic. (One of Tom’s cherished texts is “The Lady Eve,” a classic Preston Sturges comedy of remarriage.) The narrowness of the show helps it wear its drawing-room lightness well, and it is littered with tiny delights. Admire, in the first episode, the aerodynamic way Tom flings his newspaper away when bolting from the therapist’s door in fear. Watch how Louise staggers off from a moment of social embarrassment, as if she had thwacked herself in the head with a cartoon rake. I’d be fascinated to revisit Tom and Louise from time to time, like the subjects of “Seven Up” or “Before Sunrise,” to watch them pick at each other’s onion skins of feeling.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b41c92e2c9b85da1a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b41c92e2c9b85da1a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Television","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"television"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Television","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"television"},{"id":"5c2e1c762396212cbb9fc989","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762396212cbb9fc989","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Reviews","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"reviews"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Reviews","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"reviews"},{"id":"5c2e1c8c81ab3335f580f191","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8c81ab3335f580f191","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Marriage","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"marriage"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Marriage","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"marriage"}],"sections":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Television","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-television"},{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"On Television","parent":[{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"on-television"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5910a7fb6c4c222f03a82e4a","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Troy Patterson began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2016, and joined the magazine as a staff writer in 2017, covering television and culture.

American male in contemporary business-casual costume. The color of his trousers was richly nondescript. He wore the clean good sneakers of a cautious wonk working on the weekend. His wire-rimmed Ray-Bans, neither glaringly retro nor conspicuously modish, cut a young-executive profile. A corporate logo on the breast of his synthetic-wool fleece vest suggested that he worked for the limited-liability company developing One Vanderbilt Place, a super-tall skyscraper going up on East Forty-second Street, where it will tower over the row of Madison Avenue men’s stores that are the enduring old corridor of establishment style. This was late-modern capitalist menswear settling into Spring/Summer 2019\\. The fleece was the right weight to meet the cultural weather.\n\n \n\nWhen considering this fleece, we are not considering fashion as expressed in runway looks and streetwear fits, or as worn by trend-piece teens in [Hypebeast tie-dye](https://hypebeast.com/2019/5/mens-best-tie-dye-fashion-spring-2019) and workwear dads in [creative-class chore coats](https://www.gq.com/story/the-best-chore-coats-for-men), their pockets rustling with Pepperidge Farm Goldfish. We are considering the uniform of male corporate power, as practiced by aspirants to its élite levels.\n\n \n\nThis tradition—whose foundation is the business suit—is one that changes at a geological pace, and at the moment its magma is hissing. “The U.S. men’s suit market has shrunk 8% to $1\\.98 billion since 2015,” [the *Wall Street Journal* reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/men-ditch-suits-and-retailers-struggle-to-adapt-11553511602), in March, in a piece that quoted an investment-bank analyst who matches his blazer to his Lululemon stretch pants. Later that month, the top three guys on the management committee of the Goldman Sachs Group devoted their absurdly valuable time to approving a five-sentence e-mail with the subject line “Firmwide Dress Code”; the message alluded to “the changing nature of workplaces generally in favor of a more casual environment” and urged employees to “dress in a manner that is consistent with your clients’ expectations.” In April, Patagonia [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/fashion/patagonia-fleece-fintech-banking.html) that its corporate-sales program would no longer pursue new business in making co-branded fleece tops for big, scary B2B entities like financial firms, say, or super-tall-tower developers. Instead, Patagonia would develop accounts with companies whose environmental and social values reflect its own.\n\n \n\nThe importance of the Patagonia vest is that it is both an evolution of the business-casual costume and a reversion to the waistcoat of the ancient three-piece suit. The fleece vest harmonizes with values that have been invested in the suit since its emergence, in the second half of the seventeenth century. Anne Hollander’s essential book “[Sex and Suits: The Evolution of Modern Dress](https://www.amazon.com/Sex-Suits-Evolution-Modern-Dress/dp/1870626672)” describes the most desirable outfit of the era: an early form of “the coat-waistcoat-and-pants-with-shirt-and-tie scheme,” suggestive “of a changed military ideal and of the enduring conception that men’ s clothes are honest, comfortable and utilitarian, whereas women’ s are difficult, deceptive and foolish.” The fleece—plush but not pretentious, elegant on the molecular level—fits this lineage.\n\n +++inline-recirc\n+++\n\nIn the twentieth century, when money men wore suits all the time, styling matters were much more straightforward. You would simply start your job at Goldman Sachs, and, very soon, a boss would not only tell you to get your hair cut but send you to a particular place to ask for “the Goldman Sachs,” according to the [July, 1990, issue of *Spy*](https://books.google.com/books?id=Tu_Vp4DEqiQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=spy+july+1990&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiiurC3gIDiAhUQZd8KHf-2CcgQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&q&f=false), which retailed “true-life button-down tales of the corporate fashion police state.” The magazine quotes a former Goldman employee: “And at that point, within a week, my identity had been so stripped down by the corporate mentality that I said okay and just went there immediately.” On the surface, Goldman has loosened up since then—it first adopted a business-casual code during the first dot-com boom, in the late nineteen-nineties, when finance bros learned that some tech-sector hot shots would sneer at them for wearing something so “corporate” as a necktie to a meeting.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5cd09f3184305f1e3d7d03b3]||||||\n+++\n\nIn order to dress in a manner consistent with clients’ expectations, finance bros invented—collectively, like a folk ballad—variants of their tribal garb that met the admiration of tech dudes. Suit jackets were relegated to the back of the Aeron. In 2000, during an interview, I chanced getting the journalist Tom Wolfe to crack himself up about confused status-symbolism at a press event celebrating the merger of Time Warner and AOL. Riffing, Wolfe cackled at the awkwardness of the former AOL C.E.O. Steve Case (who looked like a frat pledge wearing his big brother’s navy suit to a nice dinner) and the former Time Warner C.E.O. Gerald Levin (whose tielessness and chinos struck Wolfe as reflecting a mistaken notion of what to wear to breakfast at Il Fornaio Palo Alto). These days, establishment guys pay better attention—money men wear [Allbirds](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/the-optimized-anti-style-of-allbirds-shoes), for example, in obeisance to the tastes of tech guys.\n\n \n\nThe amazing thing about the recent Goldman Sachs memo is that it decrees a standard without stating its terms. In its metaphysical proclamation that “all of us know what is and is not appropriate for the workplace,” the memo bespeaks a Babylonian code of unspoken rules. It says that professional conduct is identical to ruling-class savoir-faire, and its manners are too circumspect to say much else. “This memo should be taught in business schools,” Matt Levine, a former Goldman employee, wrote, in a [Bloomberg opinion column](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-03-06/be-careful-wearing-jeans-at-goldman). “Goldman’s dress code is that you should dress the way you’re supposed to dress at Goldman. If you have to ask, etc. The difference between a middling banker and a great one is this sort of tacit knowledge.” This is the essence of Manhattan business-casual, less a style of dress than an enigmatic language of power. It’s not necessarily exclusive in terms of price, but it’s exclusionary in terms of intent. I suspect that its sensibility trickles down from the acknowledged masters of big-money business-casual clothing: Connecticut hedge-fund guys. They are boastful of their rank. Some years ago, they were early to the trend of double-monk-strap shoes, and they later teased their Manhattan counterparts for continuing to be thus shod after they, the Connecticutters, deemed the double-monk passé.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5cd1924e92eb652e91bb6856]||||||\n+++ \n\nThe untrained eye will catch the system’s drift. Any Goldman Sachs intern will notice that the company’s chairman and C.E.O., David Solomon, is tieless in a portrait on the firm’s Web site, and wearing a shirt of lustrous French blue. The intern will recognize the shirt’s reflection in the many excellent azures adorning the torsos of men entering Goldman’s headquarters this spring. During a sixty-degree springtime lunch hour, you may see these men running out for a fast, casual bite, defenseless, in their shirt sleeves. At Citigroup, on Greenwich Street, the sharp, safe choice for a cool breeze in Q2 is a quilted jacket or vest in aristocratic navy. At any bank, on unfussy fiftysomethings, you see trim black puffers—faded, speaking at once of thrift and expensive ski lifts. The panorama of the scene is a tribute to Ralph Lauren’s prophetic vision: sportswear that’s attached to the traditional garb of monied masculinity by means of it all being stitched together with an invented crest.\n\n \n\nEverywhere there are a lot of vests, and why not? In the preppy tradition, they layer well; in the macho one, they highlight virtuous delts. The vests worn by bosses, as sumptuous as a sober manner will allow, are sometimes so lustrous that they seem carved from mahogany, sometimes so buttery that they seem made from the hides of newborn calves. And they are versatile: on a day off, while walking the dog with your boo in her yoga pants, you can wear a gray Patagonia fleece vest over a blue crewneck sweatshirt, artfully exposing the sweatshirt’s central message, which is that you went to Wharton. The other day, at happy hour at Connolly’s Pub & Restaurant, in midtown, I spotted a navy-blue Vineyard Vines fleece vest over a navy gingham shirt, a navy Nautica fleece vest over a navy gingham shirt, and an anonymous mouse-gray fleece vest over a checked flannel shirt. There was also a dude in a shining Moncler ski vest, as if this were winter in Gstaad, or something, and not sixty-one degrees on Forty-seventh Street. Accidents of costume are essential to the systemic farce.\n\n +++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5cd09fa97bf70b38e5de7450]||||||\n+++\n\nLast week, I warily approached J. Press. I had been a bit embarrassed by a response this shop—“[a default outfitter of the northeastern elite](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/fashion/j-press-preppy-shopping-new-york.html)”—had to the Goldman memo. (“J. Press remains hip to the new order,” a promotional newsletter read. “Our millennials often head over to SoHo House, a three-minute walk from the High Line, where suit and tie is no-no.”) But a visit encouraged a sense of perspective. The shop had just ordered a new print run of “[Rebel Without a Suit: The Not-So-Casual Road to Casual Friday](https://www.amazon.com/Rebel-Without-Suit-Not-So-Casual-Casual/dp/1623061067),” a brief history of the business-casual tradition, by Richard Press and Joseph Cosgriff. The authors’ account ranges from the pivotal “Aloha Fridays” of nineteen-sixties Hawaii to Dockers’s guileful direct appeals to nineteen-nineties H.R. managers and a sartorial correction that followed the 2000 Nasdaq crash, when more than a few large companies rescinded their casual dress codes, even if only temporarily. “Rebel Without a Suit” warns that “whiffing on Casual Friday gives your company another possible reason to fire you, or at least slow down what you once believed to be your meteoric rise to the top of the corporate ranks.” At first I misread that “meteoric” as “meritocratic.” That ominous note sounds like the ring of opening bell on a rag-trade sales day. There is only one rule of business-casual dressing, and it is the rule of fear.\n\n ","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b36cecf40192141d1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Fashion","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fashion"},{"id":"5c2e1dfd2396212cbb9fcb09","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Men’s Fashion","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mens-fashion"},{"id":"5c2e1da541c92e2c9b85db67","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Men’s Clothing","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mens-clothing"},{"id":"5c2e1d2e41e4c73c088d7815","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Businessmen","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"businessmen"},{"id":"5c2e1fa42bfcc72cd92d07bc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Suits","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"suits"},{"id":"5c2e1e352710c62d10815600","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Office Culture","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"office-culture"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef02c14b3c606c102766","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On and Off the Avenue","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-and-off-the-avenue"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a7fb6c4c222f03a82e4a","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Troy Patterson began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2016, and joined the magazine as a staff writer in 2017, covering television and culture.

The title of the show is a kind of triple entendre: “Special,” heavy with uplift and crowded with important messages, owes a debt to the after-school special, with all the treacle that implies. But if you stick it out through the end, eight episodes in all—easily done, on account of their affable tone and agreeably modest fifteen-minute running time—you will encounter some savory self-knowledge to cut the sweet cheer.\n\nIn adapting his 2015 memoir, “[I’m Special: And Other Lies We Tell Ourselves](https://www.amazon.com/Im-Special-Other-Lies-Ourselves/dp/1476700400),” O’Connell has renamed himself Ryan Kayes. Ryan lives with his overprotective mother (Jessica Hecht). “I’m twenty-eight years old and I haven’t done a goddam thing,” he says. Shortly, he is doing things, some of them damnable, as an intern at Eggwoke, an online magazine. His boss, Olivia, is played by Marla Mindelle, in a performance that dragon-breathes fresh life into a caricature of an infernal editrix. Early on, Olivia details the site’s revamped mission: “We’ve started publishing confessional essays, like ‘Fifty Ways to Hate Myself’ or ‘Why Do I Keep Finding Things Inside My Vagina’.” Though this line—satirical only in tone, reportorial in its content—is slightly behind the curve in its evaluation of online discourse, it is still speaks to general trends in self-monetization.\n\nFor his first trick as an Internet essayist, Ryan inflates an anecdote about a very minor injury in a car accident into a tale of trauma. It’s a viral hit and, more importantly, a cover story for his limp, enabling him to keep his condition secret even from his only work friend, Kim (Punam Patel), a South-Asian-American woman whose professional niche is to discuss her life as a “curvy girl” and whose emotional role is to support Ryan on his journey from mama’s boy to independent man. He makes a good start by getting his own apartment in Episode 3\\. He hires someone to assemble a table for him, which we might attribute to his disability, but, by the time he calls his mother to plunge a clogged toilet, his C.P. starts to seem like a ready-made metaphor for the [generational helplessness](https://www.thecut.com/2019/04/are-millennials-learning-to-outsource-their-adulthood.html) that millennials describe in online essays of the type that Ryan may one day graduate to writing.\n\nI’m struck by the degree to which “Special” echoes “[Shrill](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/18/on-shrill-and-better-things-women-stop-being-good-sports),” on Hulu, in its particular concerns and general tone as a semi-autobiographical comedy combining social satire and twentysomething self-searching. Both warmly profile fledgling journalists whose maturation depends on reconciling their feelings about their physical differences with the rest of their selves. (“Shrill” stars Aidy Bryant as Annie, the alter ego of the writer Lindy West, [upon whose boo](https://www.amazon.com/Shrill-Notes-Woman-Lindy-West/dp/0316348406/)k the series is loosely based.) Both heroes slash through the jungles of the Internet with their senses of humor—honed by lives of rejection—as their only machete. Both have been raised by mothers whose tendencies to smother express their own needs for guidance, and both are employed by editors hostile to their existences as anything other than click baiters.\n\nThe centerpiece of “Shrill” ’s first season is a sequence in its fourth episode: Annie arrives at a fat-acceptance pool party to write about liberation and leaves having achieved it. “Special,” too, has a pool party—a shindig in Olivia’s backyard. After a slo-mo Speedo montage reflecting his awe and fear among the pretty people, Ryan consents to be coaxed into his trunks and dip a toe into romance. These scenes of piscine self-revelation combine the vulnerability of a striptease with the power of baptism. They plunge into feelings of insecurity in an of-the-moment way. Encouraging Ryan into his swim trunks, the curve-celebrating Kim says, “I need to be seen.” Receiving her encouragement, he heads to the pool to work it and, thus, to claim his place in the attention economy.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cbc41e4c73c088d77db","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"TV Review","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tv-review"},{"id":"5c2e1c7722d4972cd5b83287","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Netflix","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"netflix"},{"id":"5c2e1c9281ab3335f580f198","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Streaming","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"streaming"}],"sections":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Television","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-television"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a7fb6c4c222f03a82e4a","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Troy Patterson began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2016, and joined the magazine as a staff writer in 2017, covering television and culture.

I’d hoped that the episode after “[The Battle of Winterfell](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-3-recap-the-stab-heard-round-the-world)” and its shattering of zombies would begin with “[Ding, Dong, the Witch Is Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHQLQ1Rc_Js)” joy. Instead, it began funereally, then segued to revelry, then to fireside unbuttoning, and ended not only with horror but with broken hearts across the realm. Tell the old gods and the new that I’d like to register some complaints.\n\n As the episode begins, Winterfell mourns the fallen, especially the Mormonts, Beric Dondarrion, and Archie Andrews—forgive me, that’s Theon, looking very “Riverdale” in death. Jon bellows a eulogy; torches in hand, he and Dany share a look that says, Look, our relationship is fucked, but right now we’ve got some pyres to light. The conflagration is gigundo; to her credit, Dany does not show off by wading into it and surviving. But she makes a scene in the mead hall, where the celebrations have begun, and where Gendry is looking around for his boo. As he walks by, Dany announces his parentage—with a vaguely threatening How *dare* you be the son of Robert Baratheon? vibe—and then makes him the lord of the Baratheon stronghold. Bastard no more! Davos Seaworth yells, “To Lord Gendry Baratheon, of Storm’s End!” (Later, he grouses amusingly to Tyrion about the mysterious Lord of Light: “We fight his war and win, and then he fucks off.” What did he *want*? I love Davos. I may see about ordering an onion-sigil flag.)\n\nElsewhere in the hall, Brienne puts her hand over her goblet—none for me, thanks—and Jaime removes it. These two have a lot of [hand stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFC9rcwnLow). “We fought dead things and lived to talk about it,” Jaime says, using the oldest line in the book. “If this isn’t the time to drink, when is?” Bran is partying Bran-style, by quietly sitting away from the crowd, saying things like “I don’t really *want* anymore.” Dany makes a toast to “Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!”—it’s about damn time! Tormund, after insisting that vomiting *is* celebrating, drunkenly praises Jon while sloshing a wine-filled ram horn, and Dany watches with jealousy. Mind-bending music plays, implying that she’s [freaking out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPflEZG4US8) that these happy fools won’t bend the knee, and, possibly, that she wants to murder everybody. Thankfully, Varys peers at her suspiciously.\n\nTyrion’s drinking game—a proto-“I Never”—returns, swiftly revealing that Brienne is a virgin. She leaves, and Jaime follows; Tormund is randily heartbroken. But, as in [John Hughes movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QUnSTxFZfw), the lovable sidekicks (Pod, Tormund, and, nearly, the Hound) pair off with various deus ex sexinas. Sansa approaches the Hound for a chat; she’s been sharing meaningful moments with weathered old souls in each episode. He tells her that he could have saved her from Ramsay and Littlefinger if she’d left King’s Landing with him. “Without Littlefinger and Ramsay and the rest, I would have stayed a Little Bird all my life,” she says. Few women would serenely credit their personal growth to a manipulative whoremonger and a sadistic rapist; I might have written the line differently—and, while I’m revising, all that rape.\n\nGendry finally finds Arya, who’s practicing her archery—“I *am* celebrating!”—and tells her his news. “I’m not Gendry Rivers anymore,” he says. He kisses her, kneels, declares his love, proposes. She is affectionate, but says, “[That’s not me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cve-FeN9etg).” Respect, Arya, but oof! Just figure out something *unconventional*, you guys. Gendry looks sad, I look sad, and Arya keeps shooting her arrows. (In Seasons 1 and 2, they’re awfully cute together, despite the fact that she looks about eight. Still, age-wise, they’re less creepy than, say, Emma Woodhouse and Mr. Knightley—and there’s a lot of *valor* between them.)\n\nSpeaking of which, Jaime knocks on Brienne’s door. I’m fainting in all directions. He seems curious about this virginity situation; I’m afraid to watch. I’m anxious about how Brienne’s wide-eyed awkwardness might interact with Jaime’s hard-won personal decency. They begin with flummoxed hearthside blouse-unbuttoning, followed by an abrupt shark-faced makeout. I’m rattled, but rooting for them.\n\nIn their own fraught boudoir, Jon and Dany talk of Jorah Mormont, and of love; they kiss but then seem to remember they’re related, *and* that she’s paranoid about the Iron Throne. Dany attempts to make Jon swear to secrecy about his parentage; his squinty eyes are uncomprehending. But Dany—his *word!* How can he betray it? “You are my queen,” he says. “And they are my family. We can live together.” Sure. “We can,” she says. “I’ve just told you how.” Varys and I agree: she might need to be murdered.\n\nIn the war room, tensions are high around the table map. How to destroy Cersei but not all of King’s Landing? Jon wears a pained expression, which, at this point, might just be his face. However they do it, Sansa would like to allow her exhausted armies to rest for a goddam minute first. Dany furiously rebuffs this idea; Jon says they’ll do what Dany wants. Jon is quickly becoming a jive turkey. Er, Jon—a word?, his sisters say. At the weirwood tree, with Bran tagging along, Sansa and Arya respectfully remind Jon that they don’t trust Dany, and that the four of them are “the last of the Starks.” There’s a pregnant pause, like Jon’s got some familial statements to make.\n\n“It’s your choice,” Bran pipes up. It’s fun having an all-knowing sibling to goad you from the sidelines. Jon swears them to secrecy, pre-bean-spilling; Sansa scoffs. Then he makes *Bran* tell them his news—and the scene ends! We don’t even get to see Arya and Sansa learn that Jon is their cousin, and that their father wasn’t a cheater, or that their poor mother was made to suffer for a lie. I would have happily surrendered several minutes of staring between Cersei and Tyrion—a stare-off that occurs later in the episode—to see this revelatory moment get its due.\n\nAs the armies head to King’s Landing to knock Cersei off the Iron Throne, Jaime will hang back, avoiding a conflict-of-interest scenario, and Brienne will stay, too, to protect. I’m into this—it reminds me of the end of “The Big Chill,” when the two nutty ones decide to stay upstate together for a while and just see what happens. “I’m happy that you’re happy,” Tyrion says to his brother. “I’m happy that you finally have to climb for it.” He’s excited to make tall jokes. Their conversation is interrupted when Bronn comes in with the ol’ crossbow and cheerfully calls them a pair of gold-plated cunts. He wants money from some Lannister, at some point. Hang on: Hasn’t he heard their motto?\n\nArya and the Hound have a moody conversation on horseback, each wandering lonely as a cloud and dreaming of vengeance; Sansa watches dragons fly as Tyrion asks why she’s determined to “dislike” Dany. I’m annoyed: it’s not a catfight, pal. Worse, four sane and lovable characters are bidding farewell: Tormund heads north, after telling Jon, “You weigh as much as two fleas fucking”; Jon tells him to take Ghost (!); and Sam and Gilly—*nooooooo!*—say goodbye, too. Gilly is pregnant, and Sam starts explaining why. “I’m sure he knows how it happens, Sam,” Gilly says. I’ll miss them all, and am hoping that they swoop in later, with northern wild men, canine teeth bared, or bookish suggestions to save these loons from themselves.\n\nAt this point, the episode takes a nosedive, and that nosedive’s name is Euron Greyjoy. As usual, he’s leading a fleet of ships, waiting to ambush his enemies. Leading the opposing fleet, Grey Worm and Missandei, holding hands, smiling, and looking gorgeous, enjoy their last happy moments on this godforsaken television program. Euron, the Wile E. Coyote to Qyburn’s Acme, has a deck-mounted arrow-shooting machine, which he shoots at Rhaegal, who cries out in agony and falls into the sea. At first, I thought this was a dream sequence. It wasn’t! Dany, in a rage, bears down on Euron, but, mysteriously, chooses to dodge arrows and yowl instead of Dracarysing his face off. Next, Euron shoots up our heroes’ ship. After a startling shot of underwater Dinklage, the gang washes ashore (even Varys, sputtering), sans Missandei. Cersei has her. She’s also convinced the too-eager-at-all-times Euron that she’s pregnant with *his* baby.\n\nAfter learning that things are hitting the fan in King’s Landing—what did he think was going to happen?—Jaime leaves his fur-blanketed bedchamber and saddles up his horse. Brienne races after him. “You’re a good man and you can’t save her,” she says. He disagrees—“She’s hateful and so am I.” He gallops off; she weeps; I glower. Maybe I’ll start writing fan fiction, in which these people are true to their best selves.\n\nIn the final, horrible scene, a face-off: the Grey Worm-and-Dany brigade versus Cersei and a castle of jerks. They’ve got Missandei front and center on the ramparts and Mount Clegane nearby. Cersei has [her wine-goblet smirk](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-appearances/an-art-historical-analysis-of-cersei-lannister-sipping-wine) but no wine goblet. Tyrion approaches the castle, gazing up at Cersei and her elaborate shoulder armor. “I know you don’t care about your people,” he begins, off to a good start. “They hate you and you hate them.” Then he tries to appeal to—get this—Cersei’s love of children. It does not work. Missandei’s last word, bless her, is “Dracarys.” *Somebody* had to say it. Next week: hellfire, and a possible Queen of the Ashes.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e8836cecf40192143c7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1e8836cecf40192143c7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"“Game of Thrones”","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"game-of-thrones"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"“Game of Thrones”","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"game-of-thrones"},{"id":"5c2e1fa3425c632c6cd70841","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1fa3425c632c6cd70841","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"TV Recaps","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tv-recaps"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"TV Recaps","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"tv-recaps"}],"sections":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Television","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-television"},{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"On Television","parent":[{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"on-television"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"590a04521c7a8e33fb390c11","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sarah Larson is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

We’d have to lose a bunch, logic went, some painful. Theon, some of us reasoned, would be fine to give up. He had a rough life, a grim groin situation, redemption, and a tender bowl of soup with Sansa. Some felt they could sacrifice Grey Worm or Davos Seaworth, as long as they could keep Brienne or Tormund. It was all quite ghoulish and weird, just as “Game of Thrones” has encouraged us to become: the grunting ice zombies to its Night King. But in the end we did O.K.—no dead Lannisters or Starks or Briennes of Tarth. It was a bloodbath ending in ice chips, and we emerged feeling good.\n\nAs the episode begins, in the quiet predawn hours at Winterfell, dread is all around: [black skies, black hearts, might lose](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/29/17174194/friday-night-lights-clear-eyes-full-hearts-jason-katims). Grey Worm dons his creepy helmet, Bran gets rolled out to the godswood, I frantically adjust the lighting in my living room. The lights are off in Westeros, and there’s nothing I can do in New York to improve it. I turn off everything but a pink L.E.D. plant bulb, like a weed enthusiast trying to establish a mood.\n\nAs the phalanxes stand stock still, looking tough, who should saunter up on horseback but the ninety-per-cent tedious and ten-per-cent fantastic Melisandre of Asshai, spooky wielder of fire magic? She has Jorah tell the Dothraki army to lift their swords, then says a little High Valyrian hocus-pocus, and blammo—the army’s swords burst thrillingly aflame, à la Beric Dondarrion’s. I despise battle episodes, but the panning shot of those swords lighting up in the darkness is glorious. The firesword maneuver, by my count, is the second acceptable thing Melisandre has done on this show, and I salute her for it.\n\nI’ll spare you the details of the entire battle. Suffice it to say that it begins with subtitles that read “Unsullied grunt” and “wights snarling,” and my frantically eating clementines, which is all I can contribute to the war effort. *Charge!* As Dany and Jon rev up the dragons, bringing the dracarys fireballs, great clouds of snow and ash fly around. Visibility-wise, we go from [Mr. Magoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uz3I77MB-c) to Mr. Magoo in a snowstorm.\n\nThe episode helpfully cuts between the battlefield, the dragon skies, the crypt—where mothers, children, the elderly, and able-bodied adults huddle in fear and mild embarrassment—the godswood, and the ramparts, so we can worry about [every battle, everywhere, always, in our mind](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/game-of-thrones-returns-for-season-7). The dragonfire is beautiful; the tree zone is quietish. In a fight, Edd saves Sam Tarly, then Edd dies: his watch has ended. In the crypt, Tyrion swigs from a flask; in the sky, Jon and Dany fly through what appears to be the ash cloud above [Eyjafjallajökull](https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/icelands-ashes). The soldiers rush into the castle as wights advance, and Melisandre, fire pal, magically lights the trenches—boy, she is great, I’ve decided.\n\nThe clever conversationalists of Winterfell, inevitably, are of crypt constitution. Varys, sage and camp as death yowls ever closer, says, “At least we’re already in a crypt.” Tyrion, not wanting to join the army of the dead, says, “I can think of no organization less suited to my talents.”  “Witty remarks won’t make a difference,” Sansa says. “That’s why we’re down here. None of us can do anything.” The most heroic thing they can do is “look the truth in the face.” She and Tyrion reminisce, somewhat fondly, about their improbable but not-so-bad marriage. These two have both matured. I can relate to these crypt-dwellers somehow, chatty and powerless in a world of snarling musclemen.\n\nIn the godswood, as Theon tries delivering a heartfelt speech, Bran gives him the same line he gave Jaime: Hey, man, everything you did brought you to where you are now. (In the seventies, we expressed this by singing “[Circle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yjxWfyxpqY)” around a campfire.) That settled, Bran takes off, in his own special way. “I’m going to go now,” he says, and wargs wargward, with [Little Orphan Annie eyeballs](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Little-Orphan-Annie-1/dp/1600101402). “Go where?” Theon says, uselessly, to ravens, crowing, fire, atmosphere. This is an episode with a surfeit of *atmosphere*. It reminds me of a Lillian Hellman revival I went to that was mostly stage fog.\n\nInto this vibe walks the Night King, [Snoozefest of Doom](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/an-open-letter-to-the-white-walker-army). As his wights terrifyingly breach the Winterfell fire wall, I breach the lid of a can of Pringles—clementines can’t save me now. “Archers on top!” Jaime yells. Gendry [fights with a wight, rampartly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBShN8qT4lk); Arya ninjas it up with her double-ended stabbo. The Hound, depressed, gives up—and he’s probably not *thrilled* about all this fire—and Beric is annoyed. “You can’t fight death!” the Hound grouses.\n\n“Tell *her* that!” Beric says, pointing to Arya, who’s scrabbling around and fighting like hell, as is young Lyanna Mormont, late-series fan favorite. Lyanna sees a repulsive giant, like a blue-eyed Wun-Wun with zero good qualities, or possibly the thing that Tormund killed in his youth, and she runs at it, screaming wonderfully, with a hatchet. I love this girl. He picks her up, grody King Kong to her Fay Wray. As he tries to crush her, I realize I’m actually crying—even more so as she hollers again and hatchets him in the eye, [zombie-kill](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/podcast-dept/dirty-john-looks-and-tv-adaptations-can-be-deceiving) style. They fall—oof!—and die. She reminds me of the end of “Carmen”: a gorgeous moment of bravery in the face of end-of-life unpleasantness.\n\nAfter a bunch of wight hooey with Arya in a library, and continuing anxiety in the crypt, valor, in the form of saving Arya from a wight pack, takes Beric Dondarrion. Arya and Melisandre mourn him in a cozy alcove. “The Lord brought him back for a purpose,” Melisandre says. “Now that purpose has been served.”\n\n“I know you,” Arya tells Melisandre. She doesn’t mention that she was *just* talking about her, in a leeches-and-virginity-focussed seduction ploy. “You said I’d shut many eyes forever.”\n\n“[Brown eyes, green eyes, and blue eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxDv_RTdLQo),” Melisandre says. “What do we say to the god of death?”\n\n“[Not today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Bz59sxCxcE),” Arya whispers, and charges off. Attagirl!  \n\nAt the godswood, Theon is raring to go, arrows aflame. Outside the walls, there’s a little fakeout: Dany blasts the Night King with dragonfire, but he lives, and smirkingly. Conveniently, the Night King is a drama queen: he turns slowly, he struts slowly, he lifts his arms to raise the army of the dead slowly. As with a Bond villain, preciously deployed theatrics give the good guys time to catch up. As the freshly killed of Winterfell come zombie-ing alive—poor Lyanna Mormont’s eyes open, that eerie blue, and the cellos match our woe—things are looking bad all over. Viserion crashes through a Winterfell wall, closing in on Jon with blue fire. Drogon is injured and Dany fends for herself; as a wight descends, faithful Jorah chops its head off. He and Dany fight side by side and do some damage; it’s fun to see Dany actually wield a sword, after all her tough talk. In the crypt, Tyrion kisses Sansa’s hand tenderly. My emotions return. I’m going to miss all these guys someday soon.\n\nIn the godswood, Theon has somehow fought off a legion of wights and is breathing a sigh of relief—now I just have to fight the Night King, he thinks. As the Night King appears, Bran wakes up, removes his “Back in Fifteen Minutes” sign—where the hell *was* he?—and tells Theon he’s a “good man,” thanking him. Theon gets teary. Maybe Bran went to etiquette camp on his little journey.\n\nWith the raging glory of a give-’em-hell Lyanna Mormont, Theon charges the Night King full force, but the Night King quickly runs him through with his spear—it’s a swift, sad, definitive, Rickon Stark-like death. Goodbye, dear Theon. You had a good arc. May your penis return to you in the afterlife.\n\nThe Night King approaches our raven-boy hero, to a few plaintive piano notes. With the calm of a tai-chi master, he begins to unsheathe his backpack sword. And who should come *flying through the air*—I understand neither the logistics nor the “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” physics of this, and frankly I don’t care—but *Arya effing Stark*, screaming like a warrior, Valyrian-steel dagger in hand. The Night King turns and grabs her, midair; she stabs him in the chest—with the *same dagger that was used in an attempt to kill Bran in Season 1!*—and causes him to explode into a bunch of deliriously wonderful ice cubes, his whole horrible army following suit: White Walkers, undead dragon, wights, *all* those motherfuckers. I growl-scream with such joyful force that my neighbors may dial 911, or at least 311\\. A thousand C.G.I. ice monsters go boom, and somehow it has brought me great joy. The living have vanquished the dead, and I have become a fantasy enthusiast.\n\nThat Jorah Mormont dies seems, to me, like a small price to pay. But Dany, reasonably, weeps for him, evincing not only human emotion but the willingness to get blood on her beautiful white coat. It’s touching, but I’m distracted by thoughts of Arya, and of how Gendry might react to all this. Melisandre, declaring that her work here is done, removes her magical necklace and wanders off to die on a snowy moor. Goodbye, you mysterious creature beyond my ken. Next week: monster cleanup; crypt expansion; a ticker-tape parade; cheering in a mead hall; and war among humans, just like the good old days.

Clutching a [goblet of wine](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-appearances/an-art-historical-analysis-of-cersei-lannister-sipping-wine) and unearthing our knapsack full of faces, we eagerly assume our place on the couch: National Poetry Month is here!

In and out of Westeros, we’ve aged, starting out as Aryas and ending up as wimpled Lady Olennas. (One could do worse.) In the coming weeks, before it’s all over, we’ll endure a Long Night, watch the living battle the dead, straighten out which incest we like and which incest we don’t, and learn which witch’s pregnancy prophecies prove accurate. Who will win the Game of Thrones? HBO, obviously—but in the post-[Richard Plepler era](https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/richard-plepler-hbo-1203152376/) of big hits and creative freedom, the victory may prove bittersweet. [Oysters, clams, and cockles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1ov_M5ixhE), it’s a complicated world.\n\nSo where *are* we, exactly? If you’re like me, you’re flapping around in a Narrow Sea of plot and valiantly dog-paddling toward the friendly shores of Dragonstone. For much of this past season, you’ll recall, as the White Walkers loomed ever more menacingly, there was much zipping around the Seven Kingdoms, by ravens and humans alike; contextual warging by the Three-Eyed Raven we used to call Bran, with additional research by Sam and Gilly, at the Citadel; famous heroes finally meeting and Starks finally reuniting; interminable bloviating about bending the knee; strategizing atop Cersei’s floor map and in Daenerys’s war room; switcheroos, betrayals, and the eager mining of information and dragonglass. And, beyond that, Dr. Tarly cured greyscale with more abrading than I would have liked.\n\nIn the Season 7 finale, the whole regal gang got together, like the [Super Friends at the Hall of Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvZANEAVgkQ). The good guys—the motley affiliation of Targaryen enthusiasts, etc.—were trying to convince the bad guys—Cersei and company—to team up with them to [fight the *real* enemy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dKdBlKgquw): the undead. Did this work? No. But it was fun to watch Cersei get rattled by a wight as the Hound and Jon Snow calmly demonstrated how to cut it in half, set it on fire, and give it the ol’ dragonglass shiv.\n\nIn the end, as we expected, Cersei remained a jerk, Jaime remained comparatively valiant, and the White Walker Army breached the Wall, snarling toward us like death, taxes, and continued violations of the emoluments clause. This final Wall scene was thrilling in its gorgeous horror; rewatching it, as the undead Viserion dracarysed his awful blue laserfire onto the Wall, I was annoyed to hear [John Cougar Mellencamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PErUiAyVoGc) in my head. I had poor Tormund and Beric to worry about, somewhere in the collapsing rubble. The [Season 8 trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlR4PJn8b8I) indicates—phew!—that they’re alive.\n\nIt also shows us Dany and Jon, whom the showrunners have said are now “together together,” heading toward their dragons in a snowy wilderness, like a two-car family going off to work. In the Season 7 finale, they had decided to sail together to the North, rather than fly, to indicate that they were helping, not conquering. But it would have been foolish not to *bring* the dragons, as, of course, dragon fire is the best defense against militarized ice. Meanwhile, had any of us expected the Targaryen restoration to be so erotic? How will our heroes find out that they’re nephew and aunt? And how will their dreamy facial expressions change? Will they shrug and say, “[Nobody’s perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mHhr-aaLnI)”? And Jon Snow has such a great name—do we have to call him [Aegon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n63KZH5Un8M) now?\n\nWhat else to expect? Arya, the trailer indicates, knows death’s many faces, and is looking forward to seeing at least one of them. (My money’s on Cersei, still on the kill list.) At and around Winterfell, the Starks will be among the first to deal with the undead, and the siblings may poke around in the crypt; Bran will continue to snoop, eyeballishly, throughout time and space, and we will finally learn whether Sansa’s steadfast shoring-up of grain reserves proves adequate. Gendry, having rowed back into our hearts and onto our screens, will, I assume, try his hand at blacksmithing dragonglass weaponry, and people will eventually find out what a fine regal bastard he is. In Essos and beyond, we will see what eyelinered Pacey Witter, a.k.a. Euron Greyjoy, looks like leading a mercenary army of men, horses, and elephants. We’ll find out whether Theon, Yara, Daario, Melisandre, or other back-burner forces show up unexpectedly to save any number of days; which of Old Nan’s bedtime stories will be most prophetic; and whether Podrick’s surprising lovemaking skills return as a plot point. Qyburn will keep tinkering, like a demented Merlin, and I suspect that somebody, or many somebodies, will be reanimated by fire. Lyanna Mormont will charm us. Battles will groan on at length. And whoever ultimately sits on that spiky, unpleasant sword-throne, the ending will not be a happy one. How could it be? Much of the magic of “Game of Thrones,” despite all of its dragons and necromancy, has always come via its realistic ratio of happiness to suffering—that is to say, a little within a lot—and from characters becoming wiser and worthier, bit by bit.\n\nChief among these character arcs is Jaime’s reshaping by hand loss, humility, and Brienne of Tarth—into something much nobler than a smirking, child-defenestrating sister-shtupper. A series of scenes in the Season 7 finale made his transformation especially vivid. Watching the episode in 2017, when the negotiations in the Dragonpit fell apart after a seemingly hard-line stance that Jon Snow took about truth and lies, I remember being annoyed at his childish-seeming lack of pragmatism. “When enough people make false promises, words stop meaning anything,” Jon says. “Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies. And lies won’t help us in this fight.” Rewatching it this week, after another year and a half of American politics, the speech felt much different: later in the episode, when Cersei reveals that she lied to her fellow-negotiators, and to Jaime, too, we share Jaime’s horror. After all that, it was a joy to watch Jaime turn his back on Cersei and ride north. In Season 8, he promises to “fight for the living” and to keep his promise. *Valar dohaeris*, everybody.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e8836cecf40192143c7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"“Game of Thrones”","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"game-of-thrones"},{"id":"5c2e1fa3425c632c6cd70841","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"TV Recaps","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tv-recaps"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b4a08312cd3aa6c3e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"HBO","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hbo"}],"sections":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Television","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-television"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a04521c7a8e33fb390c11","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sarah Larson is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

We’d have to lose a bunch, logic went, some painful. Theon, some of us reasoned, would be fine to give up. He had a rough life, a grim groin situation, redemption, and a tender bowl of soup with Sansa. Some felt they could sacrifice Grey Worm or Davos Seaworth, as long as they could keep Brienne or Tormund. It was all quite ghoulish and weird, just as “Game of Thrones” has encouraged us to become: the grunting ice zombies to its Night King. But in the end we did O.K.—no dead Lannisters or Starks or Briennes of Tarth. It was a bloodbath ending in ice chips, and we emerged feeling good.\n\nAs the episode begins, in the quiet predawn hours at Winterfell, dread is all around: [black skies, black hearts, might lose](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/29/17174194/friday-night-lights-clear-eyes-full-hearts-jason-katims). Grey Worm dons his creepy helmet, Bran gets rolled out to the godswood, I frantically adjust the lighting in my living room. The lights are off in Westeros, and there’s nothing I can do in New York to improve it. I turn off everything but a pink L.E.D. plant bulb, like a weed enthusiast trying to establish a mood.\n\nAs the phalanxes stand stock still, looking tough, who should saunter up on horseback but the ninety-per-cent tedious and ten-per-cent fantastic Melisandre of Asshai, spooky wielder of fire magic? She has Jorah tell the Dothraki army to lift their swords, then says a little High Valyrian hocus-pocus, and blammo—the army’s swords burst thrillingly aflame, à la Beric Dondarrion’s. I despise battle episodes, but the panning shot of those swords lighting up in the darkness is glorious. The firesword maneuver, by my count, is the second acceptable thing Melisandre has done on this show, and I salute her for it.\n\nI’ll spare you the details of the entire battle. Suffice it to say that it begins with subtitles that read “Unsullied grunt” and “wights snarling,” and my frantically eating clementines, which is all I can contribute to the war effort. *Charge!* As Dany and Jon rev up the dragons, bringing the dracarys fireballs, great clouds of snow and ash fly around. Visibility-wise, we go from [Mr. Magoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uz3I77MB-c) to Mr. Magoo in a snowstorm.\n\nThe episode helpfully cuts between the battlefield, the dragon skies, the crypt—where mothers, children, the elderly, and able-bodied adults huddle in fear and mild embarrassment—the godswood, and the ramparts, so we can worry about [every battle, everywhere, always, in our mind](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/game-of-thrones-returns-for-season-7). The dragonfire is beautiful; the tree zone is quietish. In a fight, Edd saves Sam Tarly, then Edd dies: his watch has ended. In the crypt, Tyrion swigs from a flask; in the sky, Jon and Dany fly through what appears to be the ash cloud above [Eyjafjallajökull](https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/icelands-ashes). The soldiers rush into the castle as wights advance, and Melisandre, fire pal, magically lights the trenches—boy, she is great, I’ve decided.\n\nThe clever conversationalists of Winterfell, inevitably, are of crypt constitution. Varys, sage and camp as death yowls ever closer, says, “At least we’re already in a crypt.” Tyrion, not wanting to join the army of the dead, says, “I can think of no organization less suited to my talents.”  “Witty remarks won’t make a difference,” Sansa says. “That’s why we’re down here. None of us can do anything.” The most heroic thing they can do is “look the truth in the face.” She and Tyrion reminisce, somewhat fondly, about their improbable but not-so-bad marriage. These two have both matured. I can relate to these crypt-dwellers somehow, chatty and powerless in a world of snarling musclemen.\n\nIn the godswood, as Theon tries delivering a heartfelt speech, Bran gives him the same line he gave Jaime: Hey, man, everything you did brought you to where you are now. (In the seventies, we expressed this by singing “[Circle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yjxWfyxpqY)” around a campfire.) That settled, Bran takes off, in his own special way. “I’m going to go now,” he says, and wargs wargward, with [Little Orphan Annie eyeballs](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Little-Orphan-Annie-1/dp/1600101402). “Go where?” Theon says, uselessly, to ravens, crowing, fire, atmosphere. This is an episode with a surfeit of *atmosphere*. It reminds me of a Lillian Hellman revival I went to that was mostly stage fog.\n\nInto this vibe walks the Night King, [Snoozefest of Doom](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/an-open-letter-to-the-white-walker-army). As his wights terrifyingly breach the Winterfell fire wall, I breach the lid of a can of Pringles—clementines can’t save me now. “Archers on top!” Jaime yells. Gendry [fights with a wight, rampartly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBShN8qT4lk); Arya ninjas it up with her double-ended stabbo. The Hound, depressed, gives up—and he’s probably not *thrilled* about all this fire—and Beric is annoyed. “You can’t fight death!” the Hound grouses.\n\n“Tell *her* that!” Beric says, pointing to Arya, who’s scrabbling around and fighting like hell, as is young Lyanna Mormont, late-series fan favorite. Lyanna sees a repulsive giant, like a blue-eyed Wun-Wun with zero good qualities, or possibly the thing that Tormund killed in his youth, and she runs at it, screaming wonderfully, with a hatchet. I love this girl. He picks her up, grody King Kong to her Fay Wray. As he tries to crush her, I realize I’m actually crying—even more so as she hollers again and hatchets him in the eye, [zombie-kill](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/podcast-dept/dirty-john-looks-and-tv-adaptations-can-be-deceiving) style. They fall—oof!—and die. She reminds me of the end of “Carmen”: a gorgeous moment of bravery in the face of end-of-life unpleasantness.\n\nAfter a bunch of wight hooey with Arya in a library, and continuing anxiety in the crypt, valor, in the form of saving Arya from a wight pack, takes Beric Dondarrion. Arya and Melisandre mourn him in a cozy alcove. “The Lord brought him back for a purpose,” Melisandre says. “Now that purpose has been served.”\n\n“I know you,” Arya tells Melisandre. She doesn’t mention that she was *just* talking about her, in a leeches-and-virginity-focussed seduction ploy. “You said I’d shut many eyes forever.”\n\n“[Brown eyes, green eyes, and blue eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxDv_RTdLQo),” Melisandre says. “What do we say to the god of death?”\n\n“[Not today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Bz59sxCxcE),” Arya whispers, and charges off. Attagirl!  \n\nAt the godswood, Theon is raring to go, arrows aflame. Outside the walls, there’s a little fakeout: Dany blasts the Night King with dragonfire, but he lives, and smirkingly. Conveniently, the Night King is a drama queen: he turns slowly, he struts slowly, he lifts his arms to raise the army of the dead slowly. As with a Bond villain, preciously deployed theatrics give the good guys time to catch up. As the freshly killed of Winterfell come zombie-ing alive—poor Lyanna Mormont’s eyes open, that eerie blue, and the cellos match our woe—things are looking bad all over. Viserion crashes through a Winterfell wall, closing in on Jon with blue fire. Drogon is injured and Dany fends for herself; as a wight descends, faithful Jorah chops its head off. He and Dany fight side by side and do some damage; it’s fun to see Dany actually wield a sword, after all her tough talk. In the crypt, Tyrion kisses Sansa’s hand tenderly. My emotions return. I’m going to miss all these guys someday soon.\n\nIn the godswood, Theon has somehow fought off a legion of wights and is breathing a sigh of relief—now I just have to fight the Night King, he thinks. As the Night King appears, Bran wakes up, removes his “Back in Fifteen Minutes” sign—where the hell *was* he?—and tells Theon he’s a “good man,” thanking him. Theon gets teary. Maybe Bran went to etiquette camp on his little journey.\n\nWith the raging glory of a give-’em-hell Lyanna Mormont, Theon charges the Night King full force, but the Night King quickly runs him through with his spear—it’s a swift, sad, definitive, Rickon Stark-like death. Goodbye, dear Theon. You had a good arc. May your penis return to you in the afterlife.\n\nThe Night King approaches our raven-boy hero, to a few plaintive piano notes. With the calm of a tai-chi master, he begins to unsheathe his backpack sword. And who should come *flying through the air*—I understand neither the logistics nor the “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” physics of this, and frankly I don’t care—but *Arya effing Stark*, screaming like a warrior, Valyrian-steel dagger in hand. The Night King turns and grabs her, midair; she stabs him in the chest—with the *same dagger that was used in an attempt to kill Bran in Season 1!*—and causes him to explode into a bunch of deliriously wonderful ice cubes, his whole horrible army following suit: White Walkers, undead dragon, wights, *all* those motherfuckers. I growl-scream with such joyful force that my neighbors may dial 911, or at least 311\\. A thousand C.G.I. ice monsters go boom, and somehow it has brought me great joy. The living have vanquished the dead, and I have become a fantasy enthusiast.\n\nThat Jorah Mormont dies seems, to me, like a small price to pay. But Dany, reasonably, weeps for him, evincing not only human emotion but the willingness to get blood on her beautiful white coat. It’s touching, but I’m distracted by thoughts of Arya, and of how Gendry might react to all this. Melisandre, declaring that her work here is done, removes her magical necklace and wanders off to die on a snowy moor. Goodbye, you mysterious creature beyond my ken. Next week: monster cleanup; crypt expansion; a ticker-tape parade; cheering in a mead hall; and war among humans, just like the good old days.

Excuse me—*Ser* Briennes of Tarth. Last night’s episode of “Game of Thrones” continued building intriguing themes of a gathering matriarchy to lead the fight against the army of the dead, with one red flag: Dany’s obsession with dominance, which often trumps her interest in masses-liberating, kingdom-saving, and justice-spreading. And our erstwhile feminist King in the North, Jon Snow, purer of soul than his lover-aunt, can be psychologically dim, in ways that don’t help in a matriarchy or anywhere else. This will come up later, in a crypt. Leadership is complicated.\n\nAs last night’s episode began, our doomed and plucky friends were continuing to mingle at Winterfell, pre-onslaught. And, *man*, if you thought Dany’s [first conversation with Jon](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-3-recap-revenge-served-hot-and-cold) was awkward (“Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive!”), I’d like to introduce you to Dany’s first conversation with Jaime Lannister. (I’m starting to realize that people in Westeros do *not* like people who have murdered their fathers.) She seems to be focussing on his having spilled her (crazy) father’s blood and ignoring the fact that he’s looking wonderfully rugged and earnest. Give him a *chance*, Stormborn! Dany also grouses about Cersei’s lies; Jaime concurs; Sansa points out that Jaime wronged *her* father, too. Tough crowd! Then Bran gets in on the action.\n\n“The things we do for love,” the Three-Eyed Raven pipes up, unleashing a defenestration-related zinger. (Bran is *back*, baby! Sort of.) Touché, Jaime thinks. But this battle, he reminds them, goes *beyond* loyalty, looking meaningfully at Brienne “Fuck Loyalty” of Tarth—who stands up and defends him, while I yowl in delight. “He is a man of honor,” Brienne says, and fills them in on the rape-fending-off-and-hand-chopping-off episode of yore. She tells Sansa, “He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home, because he’d sworn an oath to your mother.” This speech is a success all around; Sansa trusts Brienne; Brienne trusts Jaime; Dany grudgingly allows it; Jon does, too. I’m all over this sororal decision-making. Yet, as the scene ends, Dany detects a weird vibe with Jon. *What* could be bugging him?\n\nOn the ramparts, the Lannister brothers contemplate dying at Winterfell—they hope not to—and Jaime gazes wistfully at Brienne as the scruffy odds-n-ends army prepares for battle and Grey Worm messes with a Qyburn-lite trapdoor situation. Jaime approaches Brienne, and they talk of flanks and hilltops and squadrons, and he rather romantically says that he’d be honored to serve under her, if she’ll have him; less romantically, she scowls and ambles off.\n\nInside, we witness a Sansa-Dany détente—they’re all dealing with a lot of power dynamics, braids, and breastplates—that’s interrupted by Theon Greyjoy. “I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you’ll have me,” he tells her. (I have to say, I’m heartily enjoying all this respect that’s being offered up by the gentlemen of the Seven Kingdoms: an hour of Campion before who knows how much Tarantino.) Sansa runs to hug Theon—much nicer than a head-butt, Yara.\n\nAfter a charming scene with Gilly, in town—and a cute little kid who wants to fight, and who is told that her services will be best employed in defending the kids in the crypt—there’s a happy reunion between Jon and his main men Beric and Tormund and Edd. Things are looking grim, they tell him: the Umbers are fighting for the Night King now (eeuch!), and the undead will be upon them before sunup. But also: Tormund has lust in his heart. “The big woman still here?” he says, eyebrows aflutter. The big woman is busy storming away from Jaime’s earnest declarations, thank you very much.\n\nPreparations galore: Gendry hands out oodles of dragonglass weapons (dude has been *industrious*); spiky death traps poke out of the ground; regal beagles confer around the Stratego board. “We’re all going to die,” Tormund says. Sam is more specific: What does the Night King *want*? he asks. We’ve all been wondering that—especially after his mixed-media message of last week. “He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory,” the Three-Eyed Raven says. “That’s what death is, isn’t it? Erasing stories,” Samwell R. R. Tarly says. “Being forgotten.” Bran wants to wait for the Night King in the godswood, to lure him into a trap. I assume some kind of magic will save the day, or, failing that, Theon. “I took this castle from you,” he says to the Starks. “Let me defend you now.” Everybody’s so goddam *valiant*, I can’t stand it. \n\nOn this night before battle, fire is bringing out cozy glows in everyone’s hearts. Grey Worm and Missandei murmur before various buckets of flame; in front of a hearth, the brothers Lannister banter once more. “I wish Father were here,” Tyrion says. Jaime is startled; Tyrion murdered their father on the toilet. “I would love to see the look on his face knowing that his two sons were about to die defending Winterfell,” Tyrion says. Ruefully speaking about their pasts of whoremongering and sister-rumpy-pumpy, they drink to the perils of self-betterment. Brienne and Pod show up, as does Tormund, who seems to think that his flirting has been too subtle. He pulls up a chair. “I killed a giant when I was ten,” he says. “And then I climbed right into bed with his wife.” She suckled him with giant’s milk for three months, he continues—that’s why he’s so strong! Tormund, if you ever meet [Robin Arryn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDuwD7sSzo), I know how you can make him jealous.\n\nSex is on the minds of many. On the ramparts, Arya boozes with—then takes her leave from—the Hound and Beric. “I’m not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits,” she says. Good point: pre-death canoodling is better. Suddenly we’re in Gendry’s smoldering smithy, admiring Arya’s brand-new double-ended killing spear, sparks a-flying. It’s a multipurpose visit. “What did the Red Woman want with you?” Arya asks. His blood, of course. “I’m Robert Baratheon’s bastard,” Gendry says. “She tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me.” Reasonably, Arya has questions. First time? she says. “Yeah, I’ve never had leeches put all over my cock,” Gendry says. Another first: being aggressively hit on by a young woman he last knew as a child. Dumbstruck, and possibly thinking, Wait, how old are you again?, Gendry observes Arya’s fight scars, and also her gazongas. Arya’s assertiveness serves her well in sexual situations, we discover. “I’m not the Red Woman,” she says. “Take your own bloody pants off.” And, reader, he does. Good for you, girlfriend.\n\nBy the fire, as the talk of life and death and honor continues, Tormund growls that Brienne should be a knight, sexism be damned: “Fuck tradition!” Jaime, remembering that any knight—*him*, say—can make another knight, unsheathes his sword and asks Brienne to kneel. “In the name of the warrior, I charge you to be brave,” he says, dubbing her on the shoulder. “In the name of the father, I charge you to be just. In the name of the mother, I charge you to defend the innocent. Arise, Brienne of Tarth: a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.” All clap; Ser Brienne tears up; she and Jaime exchange respectful nods; I swoon. What if one of them *dies* for the other? I can’t stand it.\n\nAfter some upstanding Mormont situations—young Lyanna tells cousin Jorah that she’s fighting, dammit, and Sam gives Jorah his family’s Valyrian-steel sword, Heartsbane (he’d love to use it himself, but he “can’t really hold it upright”)—Podrick sings softly by the fire, having briefly turned into the Pentangle. A montage, to Podsong, of peace within the night’s tense fear: the sleeping Samwell Tarlys, Theon having emotionally intense soup with Sansa, Arya lying next to Gendry, passionate Missandei and Grey Worm, Ser Jorah and his faithful horse. But, in the crypt, all is not well for the Targaryen-Snow-Targaryens, because R + L = Yikes. Jon, standing before Lyanna Stark’s crypt, tenderly whispers to Dany the real story of Rhaegar and Lyanna’s love—and somehow doesn’t realize that her reaction to learning his parentage, after *Wha?,* will not be *Ick!* or *We’ll figure it out!* but *How dare you be the rightful heir to my throne?* Tomorrow will bring the clattering of icy death hooves—and Jon’s dragon-riding girlfriend wanting to murder him won’t help. Aegon, [take me away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjGPgs0_S0)! Meanwhile, I’m curious: How is Brienne spending her first night of knighthood? Being brave, I hope.

A zesty reel of other HBO shows we might enjoy—winter won’t last forever!—was followed by a thanks-for-the-memories montage: crossbow-on-toilet patricide, teen-wedding regicide, green-wildfire kaboom. The opening credits had the same spinning gears-’n’-spheres—but, thrillingly, instead of the Sunset Sea, the map sequence began with *ice*, the broken Wall, and the freezing menace it portends, ice dominoes tipping ever southward. We’re back!\n\nThe scene opens at Winterfell, where a Bran-in-Season 1-looking boy, scrambling to watch an approaching procession, ends up climbing a tree, as little Bran once climbed a castle wall. (Mamas, don’t let your babies grow up to be warg-boys.) In Season 1, the visitors were the Bad News Baratheons; in Season 8, it’s Queen Daenerys and friends. As the Northern menace descends, gaggles of armies and families and whatever stone-soup defenses they can rustle up are heading to Winterfell to prepare to fight the army of the dead. When Arya sees Jon ride beside Dany, she’s proud, happy, then sad: he doesn’t see her. Meanwhile, Tyrion, Varys, Missandei, Grey Worm, Gendry, the Hound, the dragons—the gang’s all there. I sigh to remember a time when I was dismayed to realize this show had dragons in it; I loved the wonder in Arya’s eyes, and the wariness in Sansa’s, as Drogon and Rhaegal swooped around in the sky.\n\nIn those long seasons when we watched the Stark kids wander all over Westeros—skulking around pubs, warging under tree roots, encountering Ed Sheeran by a campfire—we’ve waited to see them reunite. Now they do. When Jon first sees Bran, he embraces him and kisses his head; he doesn’t know that magic has ruined his personality. “You’re a man!” Jon says. “Almost,” Bran says, impassive. Jon is puzzled. (Hang on—*I’m* the zombie in this relationship!) Sansa makes a mental note to explain Bran’s new vibe later.\n\nDany and Sansa do their best to get along, but tedious knee-bending foofaraw will ensue, and Sansa is crabby about feeding the extra people, and dragons. (To the grain reserves!) Later, she catches up with her sometime husband, Tyrion. (Did these two ever get annulled, or what?) They’re up on the balcony, staring off into the courtyard. (The Winterfell balcony is to “G.o.T.” what the lido deck was to “The Love Boat.”) “Last time we spoke was at Joffrey’s wedding,” he recalls. “Miserable affair.” “It had its moments,” Sansa says, fondly remembering Joffrey’s poisoning. Then, ever the skeptic—hey, she’s earned it!—Sansa *pffs* the notion that Cersei will send her armies north, as promised. Tyrion seems startled: things that make you go [*hmm*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF2ayWcJfxo), his face says. And hmm again—there’s Bran in the courtyard, staring. Hello, oddball!\n\nMeanwhile, nutty Euron and the hot-rod Golden Company ships-for-hire are heading to King’s Landing, and Yara, Euron’s captive, is tied miserably to a pole. Upon arrival, Euron, ever the swaggering sword-swinger, announces to Queen Cersei that he’s marshalled an army of two thousand horses and twenty thousand men. “No elephants, your grace.” *What?* For once, Cersei and I agree. “That’s disappointing,” she says. You’d think that denying your queen a proffered herd of elephants would give you pause sexwise, but Euron gives seduction a shabby old try—and succeeds, though Cersei is still brooding.  “I wanted those elephants,” she says. With great, grody relish, Euron ignores this and asks if he’s better at sex than Robert and Jaime, then tells her, “I’m going to put a prince in your belly.” I’m rooting for this couple.\n\nElsewhere in the capital, and in another hat-tip to Episode 1, a man with official business to discuss (originally, Jaime) interrupts a guy in a brothel, covered in naked ladies (originally, Tyrion). Here, it’s Qyburn and Bronn, respectively. I think we can agree: nobody wants Qyburn showing up at your foursome. Qyburn gives Bronn a crossbow—yes, *that* crossbow—and suggests that he murder Cersei’s treasonous brothers: the very same pair from that first brothel scene! What a fun bunch of Easter eggs.\n\nOut in the harbor, somebody’s shooting up a boat. It’s Theon! He’s made quick work of his pledge to rescue Yara from Euron’s clutches. The writers don’t make him struggle for this act of heroism—you can practically hear them yelling, “There’s no *time*! Go, go!” Yara headbutts him. If I had to choose a family to join in Westeros, it might not be the Greyjoys. Briskly, Yara vows to return home and gives Theon permission to go Starkward and fight the Ice Things.\n\nAs other Westerosians trickle in to Winterfell, Tyrion admires the Carstarks’ sigil. “Beats an onion, anyway,” he tells Varys and Davos. Themes of Northern loyalties burble in their conversation and as Jon and Dany stroll to the dragon lot. She wants to take them out for a spin. “I don’t know how to ride a dragon!” Jon cries. But soon enough, there Jon zooms, clinging to Rhaegal’s spikes, his fur-collared Stark cloak flapping in the breeze. It’s like watching Superman ride Godzilla: extremely exciting. It’s enjoyable to see these two mighty loners, Dany and Jon, finally have a friend. They’re like a duo supergroup. As they kiss beside a waterfall, growling is heard: the Stepfather of Dragons will take some getting used to. Drogon’s glowering face is straight-up hilarious.\n\nAs we’d hoped, Gendry, secret bastard prince, has hung up his dragonglass-blacksmithing shingle. An early customer is Arya, with a special order: a diagram of a weapon, like something Leonardo da Vinci might sketch if he were a hit man. I’m charmed to see Gendry and Arya bonding again, and slightly unnerved when they tell each other they look good. How old is Arya? I’m going to assume “good” means “healthy” for now, or “alive.”\n\nReading her mail, Sansa is vexed: Lord Glover, peeved about leadership, is staying in Deepwood Motte! She and Jon bicker about Dany’s rule. “Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?” she asks. Oh, snap.\n\nSamwell Tarly, MD, also encounters some Targaryen complexity. Dany thanks him for curing Ser Jorah of greyscale, and it’s a nice moment—but soon enough they realize she’s murdered his family. (With dragonfire, natch.) Sam, crying with dignity, takes his leave and runs into Bran, who’s hanging around the courtyard, waiting to freak people out. “It’s time to tell Jon the truth,” Bran says. Jeez, kid! By this, he means that *Sam* has to tell Jon about his [secret parentage](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/game-of-thrones-season-7-finale-recap-a-dragon-a-wolf-and-an-about-face), and, ipso facto, the aunt-humping. The best place for this conversation is in a crypt. Sam tearfully tells Jon that Dany has burned his relatives to a crisp, then artfully segues to the theme of good leadership. *Jon* should be king—“of the bloody Seven Kingdoms!” Also, Jon’s parents are Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. Jon is dumbstruck—not just about the parentage but about the *lies*, man. “My father was the most honorable man I ever met,” he says. “You’re saying he lied to me all my life?” Oy! We’ll give him some time to reflect.\n\nGood news! After the Wall-and-dragon Armageddon, Tormund, Beric, and friends are alive, somehow with nary a scratch. But bad news: the Night King has left them a message. It’s not “Scram” or “Surrender, Dorothy” but a boy, Ned Umber, mounted on a wall, thrashing around screaming atop a creepy pinwheel-like symbol made of severed limbs. Compared to that, the child-harming of the series’ first episode—a glibly executed tower defenestration by a young man in love with his sister—seems positively quaint. In the final scene, Jaime, the defenestrator—now valiant, bearded, and hubba-hubba—arrives at Winterfell and takes a thoughtful look around. Guess who’s in the courtyard? Yep: Bran. Here, after everything, they meet again. Jaime looks at Bran; Bran looks at Jaime. Cue the cellos. \n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b4a08312cd3aa6c3e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"HBO","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hbo"},{"id":"5c2e1fa3425c632c6cd70841","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"TV Recaps","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tv-recaps"},{"id":"5c2e1e8836cecf40192143c7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"“Game of Thrones”","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"game-of-thrones"},{"id":"5c2e1fa336cecf401921448e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Emilia Clarke","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"emilia-clarke"},{"id":"5c2e1fa32bc86f2c9a244c66","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Kit Harington","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"kit-harington"}],"sections":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Television","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-television"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a04521c7a8e33fb390c11","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sarah Larson is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

Excuse me—*Ser* Briennes of Tarth. Last night’s episode of “Game of Thrones” continued building intriguing themes of a gathering matriarchy to lead the fight against the army of the dead, with one red flag: Dany’s obsession with dominance, which often trumps her interest in masses-liberating, kingdom-saving, and justice-spreading. And our erstwhile feminist King in the North, Jon Snow, purer of soul than his lover-aunt, can be psychologically dim, in ways that don’t help in a matriarchy or anywhere else. This will come up later, in a crypt. Leadership is complicated.\n\nAs last night’s episode began, our doomed and plucky friends were continuing to mingle at Winterfell, pre-onslaught. And, *man*, if you thought Dany’s [first conversation with Jon](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-3-recap-revenge-served-hot-and-cold) was awkward (“Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive!”), I’d like to introduce you to Dany’s first conversation with Jaime Lannister. (I’m starting to realize that people in Westeros do *not* like people who have murdered their fathers.) She seems to be focussing on his having spilled her (crazy) father’s blood and ignoring the fact that he’s looking wonderfully rugged and earnest. Give him a *chance*, Stormborn! Dany also grouses about Cersei’s lies; Jaime concurs; Sansa points out that Jaime wronged *her* father, too. Tough crowd! Then Bran gets in on the action.\n\n“The things we do for love,” the Three-Eyed Raven pipes up, unleashing a defenestration-related zinger. (Bran is *back*, baby! Sort of.) Touché, Jaime thinks. But this battle, he reminds them, goes *beyond* loyalty, looking meaningfully at Brienne “Fuck Loyalty” of Tarth—who stands up and defends him, while I yowl in delight. “He is a man of honor,” Brienne says, and fills them in on the rape-fending-off-and-hand-chopping-off episode of yore. She tells Sansa, “He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home, because he’d sworn an oath to your mother.” This speech is a success all around; Sansa trusts Brienne; Brienne trusts Jaime; Dany grudgingly allows it; Jon does, too. I’m all over this sororal decision-making. Yet, as the scene ends, Dany detects a weird vibe with Jon. *What* could be bugging him?\n\nOn the ramparts, the Lannister brothers contemplate dying at Winterfell—they hope not to—and Jaime gazes wistfully at Brienne as the scruffy odds-n-ends army prepares for battle and Grey Worm messes with a Qyburn-lite trapdoor situation. Jaime approaches Brienne, and they talk of flanks and hilltops and squadrons, and he rather romantically says that he’d be honored to serve under her, if she’ll have him; less romantically, she scowls and ambles off.\n\nInside, we witness a Sansa-Dany détente—they’re all dealing with a lot of power dynamics, braids, and breastplates—that’s interrupted by Theon Greyjoy. “I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you’ll have me,” he tells her. (I have to say, I’m heartily enjoying all this respect that’s being offered up by the gentlemen of the Seven Kingdoms: an hour of Campion before who knows how much Tarantino.) Sansa runs to hug Theon—much nicer than a head-butt, Yara.\n\nAfter a charming scene with Gilly, in town—and a cute little kid who wants to fight, and who is told that her services will be best employed in defending the kids in the crypt—there’s a happy reunion between Jon and his main men Beric and Tormund and Edd. Things are looking grim, they tell him: the Umbers are fighting for the Night King now (eeuch!), and the undead will be upon them before sunup. But also: Tormund has lust in his heart. “The big woman still here?” he says, eyebrows aflutter. The big woman is busy storming away from Jaime’s earnest declarations, thank you very much.\n\nPreparations galore: Gendry hands out oodles of dragonglass weapons (dude has been *industrious*); spiky death traps poke out of the ground; regal beagles confer around the Stratego board. “We’re all going to die,” Tormund says. Sam is more specific: What does the Night King *want*? he asks. We’ve all been wondering that—especially after his mixed-media message of last week. “He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory,” the Three-Eyed Raven says. “That’s what death is, isn’t it? Erasing stories,” Samwell R. R. Tarly says. “Being forgotten.” Bran wants to wait for the Night King in the godswood, to lure him into a trap. I assume some kind of magic will save the day, or, failing that, Theon. “I took this castle from you,” he says to the Starks. “Let me defend you now.” Everybody’s so goddam *valiant*, I can’t stand it. \n\nOn this night before battle, fire is bringing out cozy glows in everyone’s hearts. Grey Worm and Missandei murmur before various buckets of flame; in front of a hearth, the brothers Lannister banter once more. “I wish Father were here,” Tyrion says. Jaime is startled; Tyrion murdered their father on the toilet. “I would love to see the look on his face knowing that his two sons were about to die defending Winterfell,” Tyrion says. Ruefully speaking about their pasts of whoremongering and sister-rumpy-pumpy, they drink to the perils of self-betterment. Brienne and Pod show up, as does Tormund, who seems to think that his flirting has been too subtle. He pulls up a chair. “I killed a giant when I was ten,” he says. “And then I climbed right into bed with his wife.” She suckled him with giant’s milk for three months, he continues—that’s why he’s so strong! Tormund, if you ever meet [Robin Arryn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDuwD7sSzo), I know how you can make him jealous.\n\nSex is on the minds of many. On the ramparts, Arya boozes with—then takes her leave from—the Hound and Beric. “I’m not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits,” she says. Good point: pre-death canoodling is better. Suddenly we’re in Gendry’s smoldering smithy, admiring Arya’s brand-new double-ended killing spear, sparks a-flying. It’s a multipurpose visit. “What did the Red Woman want with you?” Arya asks. His blood, of course. “I’m Robert Baratheon’s bastard,” Gendry says. “She tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me.” Reasonably, Arya has questions. First time? she says. “Yeah, I’ve never had leeches put all over my cock,” Gendry says. Another first: being aggressively hit on by a young woman he last knew as a child. Dumbstruck, and possibly thinking, Wait, how old are you again?, Gendry observes Arya’s fight scars, and also her gazongas. Arya’s assertiveness serves her well in sexual situations, we discover. “I’m not the Red Woman,” she says. “Take your own bloody pants off.” And, reader, he does. Good for you, girlfriend.\n\nBy the fire, as the talk of life and death and honor continues, Tormund growls that Brienne should be a knight, sexism be damned: “Fuck tradition!” Jaime, remembering that any knight—*him*, say—can make another knight, unsheathes his sword and asks Brienne to kneel. “In the name of the warrior, I charge you to be brave,” he says, dubbing her on the shoulder. “In the name of the father, I charge you to be just. In the name of the mother, I charge you to defend the innocent. Arise, Brienne of Tarth: a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.” All clap; Ser Brienne tears up; she and Jaime exchange respectful nods; I swoon. What if one of them *dies* for the other? I can’t stand it.\n\nAfter some upstanding Mormont situations—young Lyanna tells cousin Jorah that she’s fighting, dammit, and Sam gives Jorah his family’s Valyrian-steel sword, Heartsbane (he’d love to use it himself, but he “can’t really hold it upright”)—Podrick sings softly by the fire, having briefly turned into the Pentangle. A montage, to Podsong, of peace within the night’s tense fear: the sleeping Samwell Tarlys, Theon having emotionally intense soup with Sansa, Arya lying next to Gendry, passionate Missandei and Grey Worm, Ser Jorah and his faithful horse. But, in the crypt, all is not well for the Targaryen-Snow-Targaryens, because R + L = Yikes. Jon, standing before Lyanna Stark’s crypt, tenderly whispers to Dany the real story of Rhaegar and Lyanna’s love—and somehow doesn’t realize that her reaction to learning his parentage, after *Wha?,* will not be *Ick!* or *We’ll figure it out!* but *How dare you be the rightful heir to my throne?* Tomorrow will bring the clattering of icy death hooves—and Jon’s dragon-riding girlfriend wanting to murder him won’t help. Aegon, [take me away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjGPgs0_S0)! Meanwhile, I’m curious: How is Brienne spending her first night of knighthood? Being brave, I hope.

A zesty reel of other HBO shows we might enjoy—winter won’t last forever!—was followed by a thanks-for-the-memories montage: crossbow-on-toilet patricide, teen-wedding regicide, green-wildfire kaboom. The opening credits had the same spinning gears-’n’-spheres—but, thrillingly, instead of the Sunset Sea, the map sequence began with *ice*, the broken Wall, and the freezing menace it portends, ice dominoes tipping ever southward. We’re back!\n\nThe scene opens at Winterfell, where a Bran-in-Season 1-looking boy, scrambling to watch an approaching procession, ends up climbing a tree, as little Bran once climbed a castle wall. (Mamas, don’t let your babies grow up to be warg-boys.) In Season 1, the visitors were the Bad News Baratheons; in Season 8, it’s Queen Daenerys and friends. As the Northern menace descends, gaggles of armies and families and whatever stone-soup defenses they can rustle up are heading to Winterfell to prepare to fight the army of the dead. When Arya sees Jon ride beside Dany, she’s proud, happy, then sad: he doesn’t see her. Meanwhile, Tyrion, Varys, Missandei, Grey Worm, Gendry, the Hound, the dragons—the gang’s all there. I sigh to remember a time when I was dismayed to realize this show had dragons in it; I loved the wonder in Arya’s eyes, and the wariness in Sansa’s, as Drogon and Rhaegal swooped around in the sky.\n\nIn those long seasons when we watched the Stark kids wander all over Westeros—skulking around pubs, warging under tree roots, encountering Ed Sheeran by a campfire—we’ve waited to see them reunite. Now they do. When Jon first sees Bran, he embraces him and kisses his head; he doesn’t know that magic has ruined his personality. “You’re a man!” Jon says. “Almost,” Bran says, impassive. Jon is puzzled. (Hang on—*I’m* the zombie in this relationship!) Sansa makes a mental note to explain Bran’s new vibe later.\n\nDany and Sansa do their best to get along, but tedious knee-bending foofaraw will ensue, and Sansa is crabby about feeding the extra people, and dragons. (To the grain reserves!) Later, she catches up with her sometime husband, Tyrion. (Did these two ever get annulled, or what?) They’re up on the balcony, staring off into the courtyard. (The Winterfell balcony is to “G.o.T.” what the lido deck was to “The Love Boat.”) “Last time we spoke was at Joffrey’s wedding,” he recalls. “Miserable affair.” “It had its moments,” Sansa says, fondly remembering Joffrey’s poisoning. Then, ever the skeptic—hey, she’s earned it!—Sansa *pffs* the notion that Cersei will send her armies north, as promised. Tyrion seems startled: things that make you go [*hmm*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF2ayWcJfxo), his face says. And hmm again—there’s Bran in the courtyard, staring. Hello, oddball!\n\nMeanwhile, nutty Euron and the hot-rod Golden Company ships-for-hire are heading to King’s Landing, and Yara, Euron’s captive, is tied miserably to a pole. Upon arrival, Euron, ever the swaggering sword-swinger, announces to Queen Cersei that he’s marshalled an army of two thousand horses and twenty thousand men. “No elephants, your grace.” *What?* For once, Cersei and I agree. “That’s disappointing,” she says. You’d think that denying your queen a proffered herd of elephants would give you pause sexwise, but Euron gives seduction a shabby old try—and succeeds, though Cersei is still brooding.  “I wanted those elephants,” she says. With great, grody relish, Euron ignores this and asks if he’s better at sex than Robert and Jaime, then tells her, “I’m going to put a prince in your belly.” I’m rooting for this couple.\n\nElsewhere in the capital, and in another hat-tip to Episode 1, a man with official business to discuss (originally, Jaime) interrupts a guy in a brothel, covered in naked ladies (originally, Tyrion). Here, it’s Qyburn and Bronn, respectively. I think we can agree: nobody wants Qyburn showing up at your foursome. Qyburn gives Bronn a crossbow—yes, *that* crossbow—and suggests that he murder Cersei’s treasonous brothers: the very same pair from that first brothel scene! What a fun bunch of Easter eggs.\n\nOut in the harbor, somebody’s shooting up a boat. It’s Theon! He’s made quick work of his pledge to rescue Yara from Euron’s clutches. The writers don’t make him struggle for this act of heroism—you can practically hear them yelling, “There’s no *time*! Go, go!” Yara headbutts him. If I had to choose a family to join in Westeros, it might not be the Greyjoys. Briskly, Yara vows to return home and gives Theon permission to go Starkward and fight the Ice Things.\n\nAs other Westerosians trickle in to Winterfell, Tyrion admires the Carstarks’ sigil. “Beats an onion, anyway,” he tells Varys and Davos. Themes of Northern loyalties burble in their conversation and as Jon and Dany stroll to the dragon lot. She wants to take them out for a spin. “I don’t know how to ride a dragon!” Jon cries. But soon enough, there Jon zooms, clinging to Rhaegal’s spikes, his fur-collared Stark cloak flapping in the breeze. It’s like watching Superman ride Godzilla: extremely exciting. It’s enjoyable to see these two mighty loners, Dany and Jon, finally have a friend. They’re like a duo supergroup. As they kiss beside a waterfall, growling is heard: the Stepfather of Dragons will take some getting used to. Drogon’s glowering face is straight-up hilarious.\n\nAs we’d hoped, Gendry, secret bastard prince, has hung up his dragonglass-blacksmithing shingle. An early customer is Arya, with a special order: a diagram of a weapon, like something Leonardo da Vinci might sketch if he were a hit man. I’m charmed to see Gendry and Arya bonding again, and slightly unnerved when they tell each other they look good. How old is Arya? I’m going to assume “good” means “healthy” for now, or “alive.”\n\nReading her mail, Sansa is vexed: Lord Glover, peeved about leadership, is staying in Deepwood Motte! She and Jon bicker about Dany’s rule. “Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?” she asks. Oh, snap.\n\nSamwell Tarly, MD, also encounters some Targaryen complexity. Dany thanks him for curing Ser Jorah of greyscale, and it’s a nice moment—but soon enough they realize she’s murdered his family. (With dragonfire, natch.) Sam, crying with dignity, takes his leave and runs into Bran, who’s hanging around the courtyard, waiting to freak people out. “It’s time to tell Jon the truth,” Bran says. Jeez, kid! By this, he means that *Sam* has to tell Jon about his [secret parentage](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/game-of-thrones-season-7-finale-recap-a-dragon-a-wolf-and-an-about-face), and, ipso facto, the aunt-humping. The best place for this conversation is in a crypt. Sam tearfully tells Jon that Dany has burned his relatives to a crisp, then artfully segues to the theme of good leadership. *Jon* should be king—“of the bloody Seven Kingdoms!” Also, Jon’s parents are Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. Jon is dumbstruck—not just about the parentage but about the *lies*, man. “My father was the most honorable man I ever met,” he says. “You’re saying he lied to me all my life?” Oy! We’ll give him some time to reflect.\n\nGood news! After the Wall-and-dragon Armageddon, Tormund, Beric, and friends are alive, somehow with nary a scratch. But bad news: the Night King has left them a message. It’s not “Scram” or “Surrender, Dorothy” but a boy, Ned Umber, mounted on a wall, thrashing around screaming atop a creepy pinwheel-like symbol made of severed limbs. Compared to that, the child-harming of the series’ first episode—a glibly executed tower defenestration by a young man in love with his sister—seems positively quaint. In the final scene, Jaime, the defenestrator—now valiant, bearded, and hubba-hubba—arrives at Winterfell and takes a thoughtful look around. Guess who’s in the courtyard? Yep: Bran. Here, after everything, they meet again. Jaime looks at Bran; Bran looks at Jaime. Cue the cellos. \n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b4a08312cd3aa6c3e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"HBO","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hbo"},{"id":"5c2e1fa3425c632c6cd70841","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"TV Recaps","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tv-recaps"},{"id":"5c2e1e8836cecf40192143c7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"“Game of Thrones”","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"game-of-thrones"},{"id":"5c2e1fa336cecf401921448e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Emilia Clarke","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"emilia-clarke"},{"id":"5c2e1fa32bc86f2c9a244c66","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Kit Harington","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"kit-harington"}],"sections":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Television","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-television"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a04521c7a8e33fb390c11","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sarah Larson is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

We’ve received our invitation ravens, donned our custom-made fur-collared Stark suits, and remembered concepts like sellswords, kill lists, and Beric Dondarrion. Clutching a [goblet of wine](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-appearances/an-art-historical-analysis-of-cersei-lannister-sipping-wine) and unearthing our knapsack full of faces, we eagerly assume our place on the couch: National Poetry Month is here! And so is the final season of “[Game of Thrones](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/game-of-thrones),” which we have watched for sixty-plus hours and many years of our lives. A friend observed that, when the series began, she was drawn to handsome, young Jon Snow and Robb Stark, but these days she sees the appeal of the Ned Starks and Jorah Mormonts of the world. In and out of Westeros, we’ve aged, starting out as Aryas and ending up as wimpled Lady Olennas. (One could do worse.) In the coming weeks, before it’s all over, we’ll endure a Long Night, watch the living battle the dead, straighten out which incest we like and which incest we don’t, and learn which witch’s pregnancy prophecies prove accurate. Who will win the Game of Thrones? HBO, obviously—but in the post-[Richard Plepler era](https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/richard-plepler-hbo-1203152376/) of big hits and creative freedom, the victory may prove bittersweet. [Oysters, clams, and cockles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1ov_M5ixhE), it’s a complicated world.\n\nSo where *are* we, exactly? If you’re like me, you’re flapping around in a Narrow Sea of plot and valiantly dog-paddling toward the friendly shores of Dragonstone. For much of this past season, you’ll recall, as the White Walkers loomed ever more menacingly, there was much zipping around the Seven Kingdoms, by ravens and humans alike; contextual warging by the Three-Eyed Raven we used to call Bran, with additional research by Sam and Gilly, at the Citadel; famous heroes finally meeting and Starks finally reuniting; interminable bloviating about bending the knee; strategizing atop Cersei’s floor map and in Daenerys’s war room; switcheroos, betrayals, and the eager mining of information and dragonglass. And, beyond that, Dr. Tarly cured greyscale with more abrading than I would have liked.\n\nIn the Season 7 finale, the whole regal gang got together, like the [Super Friends at the Hall of Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvZANEAVgkQ). The good guys—the motley affiliation of Targaryen enthusiasts, etc.—were trying to convince the bad guys—Cersei and company—to team up with them to [fight the *real* enemy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dKdBlKgquw): the undead. Did this work? No. But it was fun to watch Cersei get rattled by a wight as the Hound and Jon Snow calmly demonstrated how to cut it in half, set it on fire, and give it the ol’ dragonglass shiv.\n\nIn the end, as we expected, Cersei remained a jerk, Jaime remained comparatively valiant, and the White Walker Army breached the Wall, snarling toward us like death, taxes, and continued violations of the emoluments clause. This final Wall scene was thrilling in its gorgeous horror; rewatching it, as the undead Viserion dracarysed his awful blue laserfire onto the Wall, I was annoyed to hear [John Cougar Mellencamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PErUiAyVoGc) in my head. I had poor Tormund and Beric to worry about, somewhere in the collapsing rubble. The [Season 8 trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlR4PJn8b8I) indicates—phew!—that they’re alive.\n\nIt also shows us Dany and Jon, whom the showrunners have said are now “together together,” heading toward their dragons in a snowy wilderness, like a two-car family going off to work. In the Season 7 finale, they had decided to sail together to the North, rather than fly, to indicate that they were helping, not conquering. But it would have been foolish not to *bring* the dragons, as, of course, dragon fire is the best defense against militarized ice. Meanwhile, had any of us expected the Targaryen restoration to be so erotic? How will our heroes find out that they’re nephew and aunt? And how will their dreamy facial expressions change? Will they shrug and say, “[Nobody’s perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mHhr-aaLnI)”? And Jon Snow has such a great name—do we have to call him [Aegon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n63KZH5Un8M) now?\n\nWhat else to expect? Arya, the trailer indicates, knows death’s many faces, and is looking forward to seeing at least one of them. (My money’s on Cersei, still on the kill list.) At and around Winterfell, the Starks will be among the first to deal with the undead, and the siblings may poke around in the crypt; Bran will continue to snoop, eyeballishly, throughout time and space, and we will finally learn whether Sansa’s steadfast shoring-up of grain reserves proves adequate. Gendry, having rowed back into our hearts and onto our screens, will, I assume, try his hand at blacksmithing dragonglass weaponry, and people will eventually find out what a fine regal bastard he is. In Essos and beyond, we will see what eyelinered Pacey Witter, a.k.a. Euron Greyjoy, looks like leading a mercenary army of men, horses, and elephants. We’ll find out whether Theon, Yara, Daario, Melisandre, or other back-burner forces show up unexpectedly to save any number of days; which of Old Nan’s bedtime stories will be most prophetic; and whether Podrick’s surprising lovemaking skills return as a plot point. Qyburn will keep tinkering, like a demented Merlin, and I suspect that somebody, or many somebodies, will be reanimated by fire. Lyanna Mormont will charm us. Battles will groan on at length. And whoever ultimately sits on that spiky, unpleasant sword-throne, the ending will not be a happy one. How could it be? Much of the magic of “Game of Thrones,” despite all of its dragons and necromancy, has always come via its realistic ratio of happiness to suffering—that is to say, a little within a lot—and from characters becoming wiser and worthier, bit by bit.\n\nChief among these character arcs is Jaime’s reshaping by hand loss, humility, and Brienne of Tarth—into something much nobler than a smirking, child-defenestrating sister-shtupper. A series of scenes in the Season 7 finale made his transformation especially vivid. Watching the episode in 2017, when the negotiations in the Dragonpit fell apart after a seemingly hard-line stance that Jon Snow took about truth and lies, I remember being annoyed at his childish-seeming lack of pragmatism. “When enough people make false promises, words stop meaning anything,” Jon says. “Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies. And lies won’t help us in this fight.” Rewatching it this week, after another year and a half of American politics, the speech felt much different: later in the episode, when Cersei reveals that she lied to her fellow-negotiators, and to Jaime, too, we share Jaime’s horror. After all that, it was a joy to watch Jaime turn his back on Cersei and ride north. In Season 8, he promises to “fight for the living” and to keep his promise. *Valar dohaeris*, everybody.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e8836cecf40192143c7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"“Game of Thrones”","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"game-of-thrones"},{"id":"5c2e1fa3425c632c6cd70841","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"TV Recaps","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tv-recaps"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b4a08312cd3aa6c3e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"HBO","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hbo"}],"sections":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Television","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-television"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a04521c7a8e33fb390c11","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sarah Larson is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

It is a document collating [two performances](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/beyonces-triumphant-homecoming-at-coachella), last April, at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, where Beyoncé mounted a show that commandeered the traditions of historically black colleges. She cast a marching band as her conduit for a review of American music; to set the tone, she hit the stage in a hat that crowned her as Queen Nefertiti and as a drum major at once.\n\nThe thing was impressive enough seen live on a laptop, [on the Coachella livestream](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/beyonces-triumphant-homecoming-at-coachella)—one of [the very best things to screen last year](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2018-in-review/my-favorite-tv-shows-of-2018). The star sang her hits with heart, shook her ass with panache, and uplifted the race by delivering a spectacle of soul. Quite a few of the bootlegs that have pinged around YouTube in the year since have a raw charm—you can hear the fans in them babbling with giddy narration and squealing like bobbysoxers. The full thing on Netflix, framed as the fruit of artistic striving, may come close to achieving its epic ambitions, but it’s too soon to tell—the verdict won’t be in until a whole generation of children, homeschooling themselves on its choreography, have come of age.\n\n“Homecoming” is in a class of its own as a total synthesis of the pop arts: rapping and dancing, literature and stage patter, propaganda film and backstage drama, not to mention hair and makeup. A Gesamtkunstwerk, with a heap of twerk in it. But Beyoncé’s beacon is less Wagner than Duke Ellington, in that she composes a symphony in sound and movement and media and negritude. In any case, the sense of competition is essential—the movie fruitfully exploits the game-day conceit of the homecoming theme.\n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: /photos/5cb8d1fc99f58121fe04e569]||||||\n\n+++\n\nThe camera work and editing capture both the steamship scope of a big show and an alluring illusion of cabaret-club intimacy. Watch the scene reflected like a funhouse in the bell of a bopping sousaphone. Admire the band on its pyramidal riser, like the bleacher seats of Giza. Beyoncé, a canny director, knows to exalt her heroic attitudes of arena-rock posturing, hip-hop swagger, and total-diva sweep. “Homecoming” is, in postmodern fashion, and to great effect, a fan-service monument to her superstardom. She is like a Medici commissioning a masterwork to show her power, except the patron is also the master—as well as the model and the subject.\n\nBeyoncé’s proficiencies include the art of publicity, and her messaging is as precise as her melisma. Her control—and control *is* the subject of so much of this material—is such that she administers strategic doses of intimacy; the concert footage periodically gives way to behind-the-scenes sequences. I don’t think she thinks that we mistake these scraps of frankness for total candor, or an unadorned face for a soul laid bare. But the performance of “authenticity” is part of her job, so she talks, in the documentary, about scrapping an earlier plan to play Coachella after becoming pregnant with twins, whom she delivered in an emergency C-section. Her personal narrative is a journey through what life-style reporters would call a “post-baby body struggle.” Her gestures toward ordinary human scale on the “private” level make her public figure seem all the more imposing. (She also has an imperative to create images that play like tasteful infomercials for Ivy Park sweatshirts and leggings.)\n\nThe philosophical core of the behind-the-scenes passages—the artist’s statement built into the art—describes Beyoncé forging the consciousness of her race in the smithy of her soul music. It was an exquisite choice to perform, early in the show, “Lift Every Voice and Sing”—the black national anthem, a hymn full of faith that the dark past has taught us, with its chords piping memories from an A.M.E. pew to the base of the spine and up through an elated chest. It works as an invocation, entreating love and respect and a necessary evocation of humility. Later in the set, Beyoncé will, in a bravura display of headbanger hair-tossing, be issuing the order to “Bow Down (Bitches).” But thou shalt not bow down thyself to any graven image, and a pop idol on a Jumbotron definitely counts as one of those. The hymn helps put things in perspective. To pretend to divinity is simply one of her job duties. Really, she’s an itinerant deacon—her calling is to administer the sacrament that is the show.

More and more, this is the Zeitgeist: blackness as fashion.\n\n \n\nBeyoncé does not bend to trend. It was clear, when she took the stage, that she would serve as a corrective. She established her affiliation with the queen figure, emerging in a Nefertiti costume by Balmain. With a golden staff in hand, she cleared the catwalk to the exuberance of “Do Whatcha Wanna,” by New Orleans’s Rebirth Brass Band. (The sound reminded me of a night last summer, when I drifted, tipsy and full, into the Tremé bar owned by the band’s original jazz trumpeter, Kermit Ruffins, and witnessed his colorful rendition of Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth’s “See You Again.”) Behind her were bleachers stacked with dancers, drumlines, and a marching band arranged in a pyramid. This was maximalism of a gloriously disruptive intensity.\n\n \n\nIt was also an education in black expression. The lessons that Beyoncé received while growing up in Houston were the lessons that her parents received through the pride movements of the seventies. To preach these lessons at Coachella, where music is secondary to casual hedonism and faux bohemia, was a bracing act of subversion. Her performance, nearly two hours in length (she will repeat it next weekend), was rooted in feeling, specificity, and a keen sense of musical history—a mélange of New Orleans and its horns, Houston and its chopped and screwed beats, Brooklyn and its rap velocity, Kingston and its dancehall, and Nigeria and the legacy of its dissenter, Fela Kuti. To date, it was her most comprehensive retrospective, underscoring not only her Southernness but the global black vernacular that continues to shape her.\n\n +++feature-large\n+++group-2\n\n[#image: /photos/5ad4f90dcd7220727ab349e7]||||||\n[#image: /photos/5ad4f90d51fedf7258aa415d]||||||\n\n+++\n+++\n\nBeyoncé has a gift for turning black womanhood into a grand narrative, one worthy of metaphor. Two years ago, with “[Lemonade](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/30/beyonces-lemonade),” she imagined a ghostly antebellum plantation as a site of female creativity; onstage at Coachella, that site became a fictionalized H.B.C.U. Her second outfit (there were five) transformed her into the leader of a sorority: in short shorts, fringed boots, and a yellow collegiate sweatshirt emblazoned with her crest, she roused the crowd with “Crazy in Love” and “Freedom,” before a solemn rendition of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” commonly known as the black national anthem. In charming skits, she needled her male dancers—the first she’s had in years—as if they were neophytes. “Suck on my balls, pause,” they repeated after her, in a mesmerizing step show to “Sorry,” the unapologetic anthem from “Lemonade.”As she has grown older, Beyoncé has grown more deliberate in asserting her sexual authority. To the delight of the Internet, she integrated viral dances, such as the Milly Rock and the Nae Nae, into her routine. The tenacity of her choreography has long recalled the militant athleticism of the black majorette; at Coachella, the Nigerian singer Diddi Emah twirled a baton in one of the elaborately produced breaks.\n\n \n\nIn 2016, in the video for “Formation,” Beyoncé sank a police car into the waters of Louisiana—an image that suggested both the neglect of black people after Hurricane Katrina and the history of lost souls in the Atlantic. The day after that video was released, she performed the Super Bowl halftime show in Black Panther getup, and was labelled a cultural nuisance by police apologists and nervous music critics. Two years later, Beyoncé, always aware of the continuity of her story, let “Lift Every Voice” bleed into “Formation.” This was homecoming as dissent.\n\n +++feature-medium\n\n[#image: /photos/5ad4f90c8144591441756c81]||||||\n\n+++\n\nNo other living pop star is as aware of her origin, or of the truth that any origin is porous and multiple. In using snippets from Outkast, Juvenile, C-Murder, Pastor Troy, Big Freedia, and D.R.A.M. as transitions in her arrangements, Beyoncé presented herself as the inheritor of a suite of black styles. She self-cited: during the final third of her set, Destiny’s Child reunited, producing rapturous harmonies sourced from the black church.When she invited her husband, Jay-Z, on stage, for “Déjà Vu,” she summoned not only the pathos of family but that of musical heritage. At one point, she stopped singing while two dancers performed in the near-dark to the sound of Nina Simone’s “Lilac Wine.” Later, she returned to the stage with her sister, Solange, for a point-for-point reënactment of their “Get Me Bodied” music video. Though Beyoncé is fluent in mythmaking, her performances are anchored by a perfectionist discipline. Whether you paid to see her or watched at home, it was impossible to find a single step out of place.\n\n+++inline-ad\nadvertisement\n+++\n\n\nBeyoncé, the most compelling pop star of her generation, seems to have the touch of a conjurer. She knows the game. Branding this performance #Beychella is not merely social-media savvy; it’s a recognition that excelling at her art requires overpowering the arenas that would have the power to diminish her. “Thank you for allowing me to be the first black woman to headline Coachella,” she said, atop the pyramid, in the middle of her set. She added, with a smile, “Ain’t that a bitch?”\n\n +++feature-medium\n\n[#image: /photos/5ad4f90da2048e6cb0f15d2a]||||||\n\n+++","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1dd9e56e652c902747f8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Beyoncé","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"beyonce"},{"id":"5c2e1d8e2bfcc72cd92d0640","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Coachella","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"coachella"},{"id":"5c2e1c7841c92e2c9b85da17","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Music","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"music"},{"id":"5c2e1d8e41e4c73c088d788f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Music Festivals","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"music-festivals"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef01ebe912338a371720","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a75c2e2e17730741c6f7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Doreen St. Félix has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 2017.

It was a private tour, conducted on a Tuesday, the day the museum is closed to the public. (“Louvre Us Alone!” TMZ’s headline read.) The couple, both art lovers, documented the visit with a series of touristy selfies—re-creating the poses of the Hellenic statues around them—and sweet, staged candids, one of which showed the two swinging their daughter at the base of the Daru staircase, which leads to the Winged Victory of Samothrace. The most widely shared photograph showed Jay-Z and Beyoncé flanking the “Mona Lisa,” approximating her elusive expression. It was a playful dispatch from a marriage; were it not for the lack of crowds, the Carters might have seemed like any other giddy American family.\n\n[#video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/kbMqWXnpXcA](560x380)||||||\n\n\nThey aren’t. The music video for “[Apeshit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbMqWXnpXcA),” a song from “Everything Is Love,” their new joint album, finds Jay-Z and Beyoncé back in the Louvre, but much has changed since their visit in 2014\\. The album, which the couple surprise-released on Saturday, during their “On the Run II Tour,” completes a meditative trilogy about infidelity and forgiveness. The previous two installments, Beyoncé’s “[Lemonade](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/30/beyonces-lemonade)” and Jay-Z’s “4:44,” were labors of gut-wrenching introspection, chronicling the crisis in the couple’s marriage after Jay-Z’s admissions of cheating. “Everything Is Love,” by contrast, is slick and effervescent, triumphant, a return to the outlaw motif that the couple embraced years before. The storm has been weathered, Beyoncé and Jay-Z want us to know, and it has made their unit stronger. To celebrate, and to make ostentatiously official their consolidation of power, they’ve returned to the Louvre, not as tourists but as bosses.\n\nThe six-minute “Apeshit” video is a feast of juxtapositions. Directed by Ricky Saiz, it opens with the image of a black man, in fashionably torn jeans and worn sneakers, with giant white wings attached to his back. He crouches outside the museum, like an artwork that has been brought to life and set loose. He rubs his hands, bells gong, and then a wide shot captures the celestial activity on the ceilings of the Galerie d’Apollon, filtered through a multi-colored glow of music-video light. Saiz slowly pans to our power couple. Wearing complementary suits—Beyoncé’s pink, Jay’s seafoam green—they are flanking the “Mona Lisa” once again.\n\nIn the past, the Carters have been accused of being art fetishists. On “Drunk in Love,” Jay-Z raps that their foreplay ruined one of his Warhols; Beyoncé shot the music video for “7/11” on an iPhone in the Tribeca apartment that they once owned, where works by Richard Prince and David Hammons were unceremoniously on view. “Apeshit” is a gospel of acquisition, recalling in spirit the luxury-brand name-checking of the couple’s duet “Upgrade U,” from 2006\\. Twelve years ago, it was all about the Audemars Piguet watch; now it’s G8 jets and diamonds as translucent as glass. But the video is a display of something that can’t be so easily quantified: influence. Beyoncé and Jay-Z seem to suggest that their own footprint will be as indelible as that of the entire canon of Western art. (“My great-great-grandchildren already rich / That’s a lot of brown on your *Forbes* list,” Beyoncé raps, haughtily.) Saiz often captures the couple standing or sitting still, holding court with the same air of permanence as the art-historical treasures around them.\n\nIn one exception, Beyoncé and her dancers, with a synchronicity that immediately recalls the choreography of “Formation,” body-roll in front of “The Coronation of Napoleon.” A crew of black women gyrating in front of a massive colonial scene is the sort of heavy-handed image that the Internet salivates over. Already, overheated readings of the “Apeshit” video have attempted to glom onto one of two opposing ideologies: either Beyoncé and Jay-Z are priests of capitalism who appreciate art only to the extent that it reflects their wealth, or they are radicals who have smuggled blackness into a space where it has traditionally been overlooked or exploited. Both interpretations seem to me too prescriptive, and belie the video’s actual verve.\n\nThe Carters are omnivorous in their relationship to media, equally influenced by the Hellenistic era’s religious ecstasies as by [Deana Lawson’s fantasies of black intimacy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/07/deana-lawsons-kingdom-of-restored-glory), by Pipilotti Rist’s warped ebullience as by the cultural legacy of Basquiat. Their engagement with the European canon housed in the Louvre, their physical proximity to it, shouldn’t be flattened into a shorthand for transgression. It is not presented that way. They are interested, instead, in playing with tableaux. Beyoncé does not blot out the Venus de Milo; she dances next to it. The Carters are not like the beleaguered black museum worker in Essex Hemphill’s poem “Visiting Hours,” “protecting European artwork / that robbed color and movement / from my life.” Jay-Z’s demand on his song “That’s My Bitch” to “Put some colored girls in the moma” is not only about correcting an erasure but about his own potential power to ordain a new status quo. It brings to mind the ambiguity in the project of Kehinde Wiley, whose years of situating everyday black men into settings of colonial wealth culminated in his [portrait of the first black President](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-appearances/the-shifting-perspective-in-kehinde-wileys-portrait-of-barack-obama). The Carters are their own protagonists in a grand narrative of establishing a black élite.\n\nBut then there’s a tableau, reminiscent of a Deana Lawson composition, that briefly takes us into the transportive place of subversion. In the “Everything Is Love” album art, cribbed from a moment in the “Apeshit” video, the “Mona Lisa” is shown blurred in the distance, while in the foreground a black woman uses an Afro pick to freshen a man’s hair. That image gave me a primal political thrill. Beyoncé and Jay-Z have enlisted surrogates, knowing that the effect wouldn’t have been the same if the man and woman in the scene were them.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1dd9e56e652c902747f8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Beyoncé","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"beyonce"},{"id":"5c2e1cd72bc86f2c9a244a20","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Jay-Z","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"jay-z"},{"id":"5c2e1c7841c92e2c9b85da17","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Music","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"music"},{"id":"5c2e1d492bfcc72cd92d05fb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Louvre","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"louvre"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef01ebe912338a371720","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a75c2e2e17730741c6f7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Doreen St. Félix has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 2017.

Given the events of this past winter, when Hart cast himself as the chief antagonist in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science’s dilemma over who would host the Oscars, one might have expected it to cause an indelicate splash. In December, the Academy invited Hart to host, and he accepted. Soon after the announcement, old homophobic tweets of Hart’s surfaced. The Academy reportedly asked Hart to apologize, in exchange for keeping his post, but he initially refused, saying, in an Instagram video, “I’m not going to continue to go back and tap into the days of old, when I’ve moved on and I’m in a completely different space in my life.” Although Hart did eventually issue a boilerplate statement of regret, he also embarked on a defensive media campaign. Snug on Ellen DeGeneres’s couch, he complained about his critics, calling them “trolls.” Did he have no awareness of how self-pitying he sounded? \n\nIf Hart’s handling of the controversy seemed incomprehensibly idiotic to you, then “Irresponsible,” which was recorded several months prior, will seem to carry an accidental prescience.The special is entirely autobiographical, covering Hart’s second marriage, his older children’s preteen outbursts, and the foreign embarrassments of the super-rich. But much of Hart’s self-exposure in “Irresponsible” seems more like gossip management than authentic self-probing. “Lesson No. 1 that I learned is that whatever happens in Vegas does not stay in Vegas,” Hart says, shoulders collapsing in a hangdog pose. Like many other famous comedians before him, Hart has been a bad husband. Two years ago, while his second wife, Eniko Hart, was pregnant with their first child, Hart was caught up in an extortion scandal, in which an associate allegedly threatened to release a video of Hart cheating on his wife. Hart apologized publicly (and, presumably, privately) to Eniko, whom he has nicknamed his “rib”—as in Adam and Eve—but he was emphatic that the blackmailing had caused just as much harm as his indiscretions. If Hart has practiced soul-searching since then, he doesn’t show it. In “Irresponsible,” he instead directs the haranguing outward, toward the chorus of haters. Caught between the self-deprecating demands of comedy and the untouchable remove of the leading man, he tips toward the latter. “Nobody plans to fuck up,” he says, in a chastising tone. “That’s why it’s called a fuckup.”\n\nHis favorite means of punctuation is to grunt, and, though his arms cross and his legs stomp, Hart’s most violent physical move is the furrowing of his brow. Where does his chip-on-the-shoulder obstinance come from? His career began, in the early two-thousands, on amateur circuits, where he served as a battery-packed opener to bigger, and more constitutionally relaxed, comedians. In films like Jessy Terrero’s “Soul Plane” and Paul Weitz’s “Little Fockers,” Hart played a punch-line jester—a male nurse, not a doctor. Hart is five feet four and regularly made a gag of his petite frame. His willingness to embrace a comedy of whiny masculinity and Napoleon complexes propelled him to major success; he has since made odd-couple capers and slightly edgy comedies. “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” from 2017, in which he played the zoologist Franklin (Mouse) Finbar to Dwayne Johnson’s Dr. Smolder Bravestone, generated nearly a billion dollars. \n\nIn his standup, Hart is sterner than he is on the big screen. A premature old head, he sermonizes at every passing cloud, embracing the role of an emotionally repressed, disciplinarian dad. “What did I tell you guys? I don’t like to talk,” he reminds the audience, at one point in “Irresponsible,” when the subject of fidelity arises. Sweat streams down his temple as he narrates, with mock horror, the discovery that his wife watches porn. “My pride wanted to know what she was watching,” Hart says. The basic joke could have blossomed into an inquiry on the sexual urges of women, or perhaps into his powerful curiosity about what excites them. But Hart motors past subtlety, resorting to predictable dick-swinging.\n\nHart is no great social critic, but he does have a gift for needling celebrity fragility and black male vanity. On the critically underrated BET show “Real Husbands of Hollywood,” which aired between 2013 and 2016, and which Hart co-wrote, he played a viciously self-parodying version of himself. A sendup of Bravo reality TV, with a “Curb Your Enthusiasm” tinge, the show presented Hart as a grumpy Hollywood success, miserable as he struggled to keep up with the Joneses. He’d debase himself to go to an N.B.A. All-Star-weekend party. In the years since the show ended, Hart has entered the élite and seemingly lost some of his acid ability to laugh at himself. In “Irresponsible,” he speaks in underdog mantras. “Don’t run away from your bullshit. Embrace it and become better,” he tells the audience. It’s unclear whether these are the words of someone who knows he’s done wrong and needs to fix it or of a conspiracy theorist privately convinced that the haters have singled him out.\n\nDuring the Oscars saga, Hart worked hard to dispel the impression that his goofy dad-joking disguised bigotries. He was a family-values spokesman, he reminded us, a positivity spreader who’d made a video game modelled after his own handsome nuclear family. “Irresponsible,” arriving to us on a seven-month lag, is like a truth serum. What was most disturbing in Hart’s homophobic tweets was the way that he talked about his own son: “Yo if my son comes home and try’s 2 play with my daughters doll house I’m going 2 break it over his head & say n my voice ‘stop that’s gay.’&nbsp;” My colleague Michael Schulman [wrote](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/why-kevin-hart-had-to-go-as-oscars-host), at the time, about the particular damage that parents’ fear of gayness causes, with its suggestion “that love is contingent upon fear.” Now there is a thread from “Irresponsible,” sent from the past, to reawaken our unease. In one bit, Hart tells a story (presumably exaggerated) about deciding to take his son’s phone away as a punishment, and mimes grabbing the boy by the neck. The gesture alludes to “The Simpsons”—he is Homer and his son is Bart, but it’s unclear if Hart is endorsing oafish conservatism or young rebellion. He doesn’t seem to know that even Homer doesn’t strangle Bart

Has any contemporary commercial artist learned this lesson quite like Tyler Perry? His most famous character, the brusque grandmother Madea, packs an assault rifle and a Glock. She pulls the pistol out of her purse as effortlessly as sane old ladies produce those awful strawberry bonbons. In nearly a dozen stage plays, and in as many movies, Madea has taken aim at no-good freeloaders and goody-goody authorities, all while spreading a hard-headed traditionalism herself. But no one has stared down the barrel of her cultural menace more often than Perry himself. Since 1999, when he first débuted Madea, in the theatre piece “I Can Do Bad All By Myself,” Perry has played his own matriarch, wearing a gray press-and-curl wig and a muumuu and covering his six-foot-five frame with a stuffed suit. Perry is Madea, but, in a sense, it’s Madea who owns Perry. \n\nHe’s thought about killing her for at least a decade. For one thing, the suit is heavy and the makeup is smothering. Now he’s about to turn fifty, and has a child and a girlfriend offscreen; he will probably one day be Hollywood’s first black male billionaire. As a dramatic actor, in thrillers like “Alex Cross,” and “Gone Girl,” Perry is capable of barrel-chested valor (though it would have been nearly impossible for anyone to summon gravitas as Colin Powell in Adam McKay’s “Vice,” given the hollow script, and the fact that Perry’s chin quiver calls to mind Madea’s neck roll did him no extra favors). \n\nPerry did nearly “off” Madea once,  in “Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,” a couple of years ago, but, like a zombie or like Jesus, whom she so merrily misquotes, she rose again. “It’s time for me to kill that old bitch,” Perry told the radio host Bevy Smith, last fall. “A Madea Family Funeral,” which was released earlier this month, is, according to Perry, the last Madea movie. Even so, he couldn’t bring himself to fully destroy his creation. On the movie’s poster, she lounges on a coffin that belongs to someone else, praise hands up.\n\nThe torment of Perry’s mommy drag is charmingly Freudian. In his Madea films, Perry also plays a lawyerly version of himself, named Brian, a nephew of Madea’s who, with terrorized obedience, chauffeurs her around town after a judge suspends her license. Perry has explained that he based Madea, in part, on his own aunts and his beloved mother, who raised her son with a moral stringency that countered the moral deficiency of his father, who was abusive. (After his mother’s death, Perry learned that she had lied to him, and that his biological father was someone else.) Set the autobiographical inspiration aside, though, and you’ll notice that Madea bears little resemblance to older black women in the real world. She smokes weed, curses, and spits. She self-identifies as a thug. She could steal your man and your wallet. Her religiosity is unorthodox—she interprets the Bible’s “Peace, be still,” to refer to the “piece o’ steel” she keeps in her purse. Her Southern accent—“Hallelujer!” “Praise da Lort!” “Hellur!”—is not one found in nature.\n\nMabel (Madea) Simmons is a laugh-track mommie dearest, a vulgar mammy whose charges aren’t wet white babies but wayward black young adults. She hails from a dubious performance tradition that started in minstrel theatres, in the nineteenth century, and, since the nineteen-eighties, has been floridly revived by black male comedians doing intra-racial pseudo-drag. The difference between Perry’s Madea and Martin Lawrence’s Big Momma or Eddie Murphy’s Anna Klump is that Madea plays the role of the pragmatic moralist in Perry’s cosmos; the Madea movies are mouthy morality plays for the entertainment of black women. Perry’s secondary female characters are either professionally and romantically insecure, falling for dark-skinned mogul-tyrants, as in “Diary of a Mad Black Woman,” or they’re too stubborn to submit to hard-working, light-skinned brothers, as in “Madea’s Family Reunion.” Madea presides over the domestic turmoil of her various nieces, neighbors, and foster daughters, pinching their ears and swatting their behinds until all the family trauma is exorcised and replaced with strong-willed common sense. Cicely Tyson or Maya Angelou might even make a cameo, to firm up the feeling of ancestral dignity.\n\nPerry’s movies and television shows are formulaic and clichéd, yet they have achieved enormous success. White critics don’t like them, but their reviews are polite pans, not referendums on Perry’s soul. (As Hilton Als wrote, in [a *New Yorker* piece on Perry in 2010](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/04/26/mamas-gun), “No white critic wants to tell a black man what he can or cannot say about his own society.”) For black critics, more is at stake. For years, the reaction was uniform hostility toward Perry’s embrace of melodrama and stereotype. In 2009, Spike Lee called Perry’s sitcoms “Meet the Browns” and “House of Payne” “coonery and buffoonery.” In a [profile](https://www.vulture.com/2015/12/tyler-perry-oprah-c-v-r.html) of Perry for *New York* magazine, in 2015, Rembert Browne wrote that the negative feelings toward the director “aren’t about his business sense, his ability to direct, or his acting chops—typically, they’re about him as a net loss for the black race.”\n\nOver time, though, the wholesale critical rejection of Perry has softened into a begrudging acceptance, and perhaps even a cringing love. When “Boo! A Madea Halloween” came out, I received texts from friends, their tones hesitant, asking if we should go see it. “I did not expect to enjoy this show,” Browne wrote, of seeing a production of “Madea on the Run.” “But, after a few minutes, I slipped up and laughed.” I laugh at Perry movies a lot, too. When I was a kid, my mother would buy bootlegs of his plays and films by the pack, from a kindly hawker who would come by the salon where she got her hair done. Back then, my critical faculties were barely developed, and I hadn’t yet learned to distrust that which primitively pleased me. Movies were not mirrors. I hadn’t yet come to understand that there is a ghastly aura surrounding the activity of black consumption, shading the outré with a pallor of paranoia and pain.\n\nAt the time Spike Lee made his comments, Perry responded by accusing the auteur of bourgie condescension. “Spike Lee can go straight to hell,” he said, at a press conference for “Madea’s Big Happy Family.” Then he grew grandiose: “Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. DuBois went through the exact same thing. Langston Hughes said that Zora Neale Hurston, the woman who wrote ‘Their Eyes Were Watching God,’ was a new version of the ‘darkie’ because she spoke in a Southern dialect and a Southern tone. And I’m sick of it from us; we don’t have to worry about anybody else trying to destroy us and take shots, because we do it to ourselves.” Perry had clearly lost all sense of proportion; “Madea Goes to Jail” is not as rich a text as Hurston’s “How it Feels to Be Colored Me.” (Although Perry’s artistic intent feels more guileless than chauvinistic, I’m not thrilled by the idea of girls watching his films without debriefs.) But I think that black women who are entertained by Perry, from his initial audience of churchgoers to younger, secular crowds, are not deriving their sense of personal esteem from his sermons. Lee later admitted just as much; in an interview with Oprah, who has long been a business partner and advocate of Perry’s, Lee said that he thought he might work with Perry one day. Perry’s pure eschewal of white opinion, and his Trojan-horsing of black talent, is admirable. While white Hollywood was underselling the skills of Lynn Whitfield, Viola Davis, Taraji P. Henson, and Gabrielle Union, Perry was giving these performers platforms. Madea is stupid, but her stupidity is comfortably numbing, an anesthetic injected into the part of my brain that demands the impossible of black women onscreen.  \n\nTo mark her retirement, Perry is taking Madea on a countrywide farewell stage tour. Beyoncé and Jay-Z went to one of the performances. I can’t, in good conscience, recommend “A Madea Family Funeral” or subject it to the pressure of critical analysis. The plot is that Madea and her posse of horny senior citizens (including Perry as Madea’s brother Joe and a wheelchair-bound war veteran named Heathrow) walk in on a commotion in a hotel room. On the day of his wedding anniversary, a relative of Madea’s had scheduled a tryst with his dominatrix mistress, and then lost consciousness during the act. The sight of leather-bound breasts, Joe suggests, has stunned him into a heart attack; the creepy mortician demonstrates to the family that the corpse’s lingering erection prevents the casket from staying shut. In typical Perry fashion, Madea, who guards the infidelity from the widow, says one wise thing: “Folk get mad at you when you tell them something about they husband.” The widow, in a teary sequence, reveals that her husband emotionally abused her, and that she’s happy that he’s dead. Then she toodle-loos off to Vegas, her overnight “ho bag” in hand, and her new beau, played by Mike Tyson, waiting outside in a car. This apparent slackening of Perry’s conservatism is perhaps the surest sign that Madea’s work here is done. Her reign was ridiculous, and it was ours.

Physical excess is Schumer’s ethos. As our national bachelorette, she has drained a [wine glass the size of a bucket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM2RUVnTlvs) and distributed digit-shaped snacks called “[finger blasters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfPRAE2xfcc)” to teens, on her Comedy Central sketch show, “Inside Amy Schumer.” It does not suffice simply to inform an audience of the depth and size of her vagina; Schumer needs you to know its scent. (“On its best day,” she muses in “The Leather Special,” her first standup show for Netflix, “my pussy smells like a small barnyard animal.”) But, as the promotional poster’s visual metaphor unsubtly suggests, Schumer’s comedy of self-humiliation is going through changes. Her boyfriend, the chef Chris Fischer, who once nursed her through a bout of diarrhea in Paris, has graduated to husband. Schumer is pregnant with their first child, and also pregnant with an indistinct ruefulness. The dirtbag sexual nihilism of early Schumer thaws out in “Growing,” leaving her with little solid ground. \n\n“Growing” has a sleepy volubility; the erstwhile bar hound is now reminiscing with girlfriends about her wilder days over a nice but very long brunch. “I used to do something a lot of comics do,” Schumer begins the show by saying. “I would blame my disgusting behavior on the city I was in.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ‘Denver, you made me fuck that stranger—no condom. You’re crazy, Denver!’&nbsp;” The joke’s rearview construction hints at some potential self-disclosure to come. The paradox of Schumer as an artist is that, though she does not think twice about showing us her pink parts, she is nearly conservative when it comes to exposing, or not exposing, her private mind. At the opening of “Growing,” Schumer perfectly tees up to challenge her own impersonal mode of heterosexual grievance. But then she closes the aperture, too busy now setting up the special’s single beat of non-doggy-style choreography: she lifts her dress to show her protruding stomach, her navel bandaged to protect the crowd from seeing how pregnancy has deformed it.\n\nBefore the audience has a chance to consecrate the entertainer, she tells them, “I’m contractually obligated to be out here, guys,” adding, “I’m not, like, ‘I don’t care. The show must go on.’ I’m, like, ‘I will be sued by Live Nation.’&nbsp;” The real talk is a toss-off; if it has a purpose, it is to rustle up briefly a trendy sense of worker solidarity between the millionaire and those at home. But, intentionally or not, the comment braces because it conveys a raw annoyance. I hate to compare automatically Schumer in “Growing” to Ali Wong, who recorded her two Netflix standup specials while [heavily](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/03/ali-wongs-radical-raunch) [pregnant](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/ali-wongs-comedy-ivanka-trumps-instagram-and-the-rights-of-mothers). But their common use of gestation as comic body horror warrants a moment. (In [a recent interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/arts/television/amy-schumer-growing-netflix.html) with the *Times*, Schumer, who has been accused of stealing jokes, admits that she asked her friend John Mulaney to cross-check Wong’s specials for unintentional similarities.) The grand payoff to “Baby Cobra,” Wong’s début special, actually came two years later, in her follow-up, “Hard Knock Wife.” During the second go-around, Wong never comments on the fact that she’s pregnant again, elevating her torso to a gag both visual and philosophical. For Schumer, pregnancy is intrusive and foreign—she suffers from hyperemesis, meaning she vomits nearly every day. (During the *Times* interview, the reporter witnessed Schumer throw up twice.) \n\nSchumer’s knee-jerk overshare here aspires to more than the quick, gross-out response. But her exhibitionism does not amount to real confession. Schumer talks of yeast infections and drinking while pregnant, and, in an extended musing on the topic of menstruation, raves about Thinx “period-proof” underwear. Much of her material angles away from her actor persona and her celebrity power, a decision that burdens the performance with a preposterous unreality. In recent years, Schumer has starred in as many network comedy specials as Hollywood films. \n\nToward the middle of “Growing,” Schumer does an *am-I-right-ladies* riff (perhaps women should respond to unsolicited dick pics with their own “favorite dick pics”!) that made me think of the faux-empowerment propaganda of her 2018 film, “[I Feel Pretty](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/i-feel-pretty-reviewed-another-waste-of-amy-schumer).” In it, Schumer, whose movies always turn on the trope of the unruly woman, is a cog at a makeup company who requires a head injury in order to think herself attractive and professionally capable. “I Feel Pretty” chastises those who consume images of female perfection for being vulnerable to the influence of advertising; it ends with Schumer’s character preaching over a grid of multi-ethnic faces. The movie’s trailer, which basically gave away the entire treacly plot, did not receive a warm welcome when it was released online. Women do not need more content telling them that beauty standards are all in their heads, many pointed out. Schumer attempted to deëscalate, saying, “I don’t want anything keeping women from living up to their full potential, and this movie’s about that.” That’s an O.K. line on the red carpet, but, now that the millions have been made, I expected Schumer to address the backlash against the film, which she didn’t write, or her weird and furtive gender optimism—*something*. But, in “Growing,” there is nothing except a lingering friction between Schumer the comedian and Schumer the actor, the latter threatening to undermine the former’s jokes. \n\nReticence, and the unwillingness to acknowledge reticence, stunts “Growing,” but I think that I understand Schumer’s detachment. The comedian has earned some of [the criticisms](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/06/dont-believe-her-defenders-amy-schumers-jokes-are-racist/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.873dd670d350) of her white-girl naïveté, which evidently still rankle her—“You look around,” she says, while miming how women stealthily solicit extra tampons, “like you’re gonna say something racist. And, whatever race you thought I meant, that’s your problem.” But the fair critiques have inadvertently sanctioned plain and simple misogyny, and an unfocussed loathing of her brand of vulgar irreverence. Reminding the audience that one in three women will be assaulted in her lifetime (and that the frequency is higher for trans women and women of color) and channelling the Margaret Atwood quotation about women fearing getting killed while men fear ridicule, Schumer seems to be seeking to armor herself against reflexive distrust from the “woke” set. At one point in “Growing,” she says, “It’s tough to stay confident as a girl.” What transmits, as in “I Feel Pretty,” is a Hallmark ventriloquism, but one story she tells feels deeper than truism. Last October, she and three hundred others were detained at the Hart Senate Office Building, in D.C., during a protest of [Brett Kavanaugh’s impending Supreme Court confirmation](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-ford-kavanaugh-hearings-will-be-remembered-for-their-grotesque-display-of-patriarchal-resentment). In a subsequent riff, Schumer links concerned-citizen hope with frat-girl cynicism—a balance, that, if deeply developed, might be the key to the maturation of her standup. “I want to be able to tell this kid I did everything I could,” she says. “And D.C., I heard, has the best cocaine.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e8601de442c9e3e5fe9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Amy Schumer","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"amy-schumer"},{"id":"5c2e1d6322d4972cd5b83370","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Standup Comedy","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"standup-comedy"},{"id":"5c2e1c7741c92e2c9b85da13","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Comedy","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"comedy"},{"id":"5c2e1ce5e56e652c90274703","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Pregnancy","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"pregnancy"}],"sections":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Television","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-television"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a75c2e2e17730741c6f7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Doreen St. Félix has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 2017.

A zesty reel of other HBO shows we might enjoy—winter won’t last forever!—was followed by a thanks-for-the-memories montage: crossbow-on-toilet patricide, teen-wedding regicide, green-wildfire kaboom. The opening credits had the same spinning gears-’n’-spheres—but, thrillingly, instead of the Sunset Sea, the map sequence began with *ice*, the broken Wall, and the freezing menace it portends, ice dominoes tipping ever southward. We’re back!\n\nThe scene opens at Winterfell, where a Bran-in-Season 1-looking boy, scrambling to watch an approaching procession, ends up climbing a tree, as little Bran once climbed a castle wall. (Mamas, don’t let your babies grow up to be warg-boys.) In Season 1, the visitors were the Bad News Baratheons; in Season 8, it’s Queen Daenerys and friends. As the Northern menace descends, gaggles of armies and families and whatever stone-soup defenses they can rustle up are heading to Winterfell to prepare to fight the army of the dead. When Arya sees Jon ride beside Dany, she’s proud, happy, then sad: he doesn’t see her. Meanwhile, Tyrion, Varys, Missandei, Grey Worm, Gendry, the Hound, the dragons—the gang’s all there. I sigh to remember a time when I was dismayed to realize this show had dragons in it; I loved the wonder in Arya’s eyes, and the wariness in Sansa’s, as Drogon and Rhaegal swooped around in the sky.\n\nIn those long seasons when we watched the Stark kids wander all over Westeros—skulking around pubs, warging under tree roots, encountering Ed Sheeran by a campfire—we’ve waited to see them reunite. Now they do. When Jon first sees Bran, he embraces him and kisses his head; he doesn’t know that magic has ruined his personality. “You’re a man!” Jon says. “Almost,” Bran says, impassive. Jon is puzzled. (Hang on—*I’m* the zombie in this relationship!) Sansa makes a mental note to explain Bran’s new vibe later.\n\nDany and Sansa do their best to get along, but tedious knee-bending foofaraw will ensue, and Sansa is crabby about feeding the extra people, and dragons. (To the grain reserves!) Later, she catches up with her sometime husband, Tyrion. (Did these two ever get annulled, or what?) They’re up on the balcony, staring off into the courtyard. (The Winterfell balcony is to “G.o.T.” what the lido deck was to “The Love Boat.”) “Last time we spoke was at Joffrey’s wedding,” he recalls. “Miserable affair.” “It had its moments,” Sansa says, fondly remembering Joffrey’s poisoning. Then, ever the skeptic—hey, she’s earned it!—Sansa *pffs* the notion that Cersei will send her armies north, as promised. Tyrion seems startled: things that make you go [*hmm*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF2ayWcJfxo), his face says. And hmm again—there’s Bran in the courtyard, staring. Hello, oddball!\n\nMeanwhile, nutty Euron and the hot-rod Golden Company ships-for-hire are heading to King’s Landing, and Yara, Euron’s captive, is tied miserably to a pole. Upon arrival, Euron, ever the swaggering sword-swinger, announces to Queen Cersei that he’s marshalled an army of two thousand horses and twenty thousand men. “No elephants, your grace.” *What?* For once, Cersei and I agree. “That’s disappointing,” she says. You’d think that denying your queen a proffered herd of elephants would give you pause sexwise, but Euron gives seduction a shabby old try—and succeeds, though Cersei is still brooding.  “I wanted those elephants,” she says. With great, grody relish, Euron ignores this and asks if he’s better at sex than Robert and Jaime, then tells her, “I’m going to put a prince in your belly.” I’m rooting for this couple.\n\nElsewhere in the capital, and in another hat-tip to Episode 1, a man with official business to discuss (originally, Jaime) interrupts a guy in a brothel, covered in naked ladies (originally, Tyrion). Here, it’s Qyburn and Bronn, respectively. I think we can agree: nobody wants Qyburn showing up at your foursome. Qyburn gives Bronn a crossbow—yes, *that* crossbow—and suggests that he murder Cersei’s treasonous brothers: the very same pair from that first brothel scene! What a fun bunch of Easter eggs.\n\nOut in the harbor, somebody’s shooting up a boat. It’s Theon! He’s made quick work of his pledge to rescue Yara from Euron’s clutches. The writers don’t make him struggle for this act of heroism—you can practically hear them yelling, “There’s no *time*! Go, go!” Yara headbutts him. If I had to choose a family to join in Westeros, it might not be the Greyjoys. Briskly, Yara vows to return home and gives Theon permission to go Starkward and fight the Ice Things.\n\nAs other Westerosians trickle in to Winterfell, Tyrion admires the Carstarks’ sigil. “Beats an onion, anyway,” he tells Varys and Davos. Themes of Northern loyalties burble in their conversation and as Jon and Dany stroll to the dragon lot. She wants to take them out for a spin. “I don’t know how to ride a dragon!” Jon cries. But soon enough, there Jon zooms, clinging to Rhaegal’s spikes, his fur-collared Stark cloak flapping in the breeze. It’s like watching Superman ride Godzilla: extremely exciting. It’s enjoyable to see these two mighty loners, Dany and Jon, finally have a friend. They’re like a duo supergroup. As they kiss beside a waterfall, growling is heard: the Stepfather of Dragons will take some getting used to. Drogon’s glowering face is straight-up hilarious.\n\nAs we’d hoped, Gendry, secret bastard prince, has hung up his dragonglass-blacksmithing shingle. An early customer is Arya, with a special order: a diagram of a weapon, like something Leonardo da Vinci might sketch if he were a hit man. I’m charmed to see Gendry and Arya bonding again, and slightly unnerved when they tell each other they look good. How old is Arya? I’m going to assume “good” means “healthy” for now, or “alive.”\n\nReading her mail, Sansa is vexed: Lord Glover, peeved about leadership, is staying in Deepwood Motte! She and Jon bicker about Dany’s rule. “Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?” she asks. Oh, snap.\n\nSamwell Tarly, MD, also encounters some Targaryen complexity. Dany thanks him for curing Ser Jorah of greyscale, and it’s a nice moment—but soon enough they realize she’s murdered his family. (With dragonfire, natch.) Sam, crying with dignity, takes his leave and runs into Bran, who’s hanging around the courtyard, waiting to freak people out. “It’s time to tell Jon the truth,” Bran says. Jeez, kid! By this, he means that *Sam* has to tell Jon about his [secret parentage](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/game-of-thrones-season-7-finale-recap-a-dragon-a-wolf-and-an-about-face), and, ipso facto, the aunt-humping. The best place for this conversation is in a crypt. Sam tearfully tells Jon that Dany has burned his relatives to a crisp, then artfully segues to the theme of good leadership. *Jon* should be king—“of the bloody Seven Kingdoms!” Also, Jon’s parents are Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. Jon is dumbstruck—not just about the parentage but about the *lies*, man. “My father was the most honorable man I ever met,” he says. “You’re saying he lied to me all my life?” Oy! We’ll give him some time to reflect.\n\nGood news! After the Wall-and-dragon Armageddon, Tormund, Beric, and friends are alive, somehow with nary a scratch. But bad news: the Night King has left them a message. It’s not “Scram” or “Surrender, Dorothy” but a boy, Ned Umber, mounted on a wall, thrashing around screaming atop a creepy pinwheel-like symbol made of severed limbs. Compared to that, the child-harming of the series’ first episode—a glibly executed tower defenestration by a young man in love with his sister—seems positively quaint. In the final scene, Jaime, the defenestrator—now valiant, bearded, and hubba-hubba—arrives at Winterfell and takes a thoughtful look around. Guess who’s in the courtyard? Yep: Bran. Here, after everything, they meet again. Jaime looks at Bran; Bran looks at Jaime. Cue the cellos. \n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b4a08312cd3aa6c3e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b4a08312cd3aa6c3e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"HBO","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hbo"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"HBO","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"hbo"},{"id":"5c2e1fa3425c632c6cd70841","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1fa3425c632c6cd70841","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"TV

We’ve received our invitation ravens, donned our custom-made fur-collared Stark suits, and remembered concepts like sellswords, kill lists, and Beric Dondarrion. Clutching a [goblet of wine](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-appearances/an-art-historical-analysis-of-cersei-lannister-sipping-wine) and unearthing our knapsack full of faces, we eagerly assume our place on the couch: National Poetry Month is here! And so is the final season of “[Game of Thrones](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/game-of-thrones),” which we have watched for sixty-plus hours and many years of our lives. A friend observed that, when the series began, she was drawn to handsome, young Jon Snow and Robb Stark, but these days she sees the appeal of the Ned Starks and Jorah Mormonts of the world. In and out of Westeros, we’ve aged, starting out as Aryas and ending up as wimpled Lady Olennas. (One could do worse.) In the coming weeks, before it’s all over, we’ll endure a Long Night, watch the living battle the dead, straighten out which incest we like and which incest we don’t, and learn which witch’s pregnancy prophecies prove accurate. Who will win the Game of Thrones? HBO, obviously—but in the post-[Richard Plepler era](https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/richard-plepler-hbo-1203152376/) of big hits and creative freedom, the victory may prove bittersweet. [Oysters, clams, and cockles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1ov_M5ixhE), it’s a complicated world.\n\nSo where *are* we, exactly? If you’re like me, you’re flapping around in a Narrow Sea of plot and valiantly dog-paddling toward the friendly shores of Dragonstone. For much of this past season, you’ll recall, as the White Walkers loomed ever more menacingly, there was much zipping around the Seven Kingdoms, by ravens and humans alike; contextual warging by the Three-Eyed Raven we used to call Bran, with additional research by Sam and Gilly, at the Citadel; famous heroes finally meeting and Starks finally reuniting; interminable bloviating about bending the knee; strategizing atop Cersei’s floor map and in Daenerys’s war room; switcheroos, betrayals, and the eager mining of information and dragonglass. And, beyond that, Dr. Tarly cured greyscale with more abrading than I would have liked.\n\nIn the Season 7 finale, the whole regal gang got together, like the [Super Friends at the Hall of Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvZANEAVgkQ). The good guys—the motley affiliation of Targaryen enthusiasts, etc.—were trying to convince the bad guys—Cersei and company—to team up with them to [fight the *real* enemy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dKdBlKgquw): the undead. Did this work? No. But it was fun to watch Cersei get rattled by a wight as the Hound and Jon Snow calmly demonstrated how to cut it in half, set it on fire, and give it the ol’ dragonglass shiv.\n\nIn the end, as we expected, Cersei remained a jerk, Jaime remained comparatively valiant, and the White Walker Army breached the Wall, snarling toward us like death, taxes, and continued violations of the emoluments clause. This final Wall scene was thrilling in its gorgeous horror; rewatching it, as the undead Viserion dracarysed his awful blue laserfire onto the Wall, I was annoyed to hear [John Cougar Mellencamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PErUiAyVoGc) in my head. I had poor Tormund and Beric to worry about, somewhere in the collapsing rubble. The [Season 8 trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlR4PJn8b8I) indicates—phew!—that they’re alive.\n\nIt also shows us Dany and Jon, whom the showrunners have said are now “together together,” heading toward their dragons in a snowy wilderness, like a two-car family going off to work. In the Season 7 finale, they had decided to sail together to the North, rather than fly, to indicate that they were helping, not conquering. But it would have been foolish not to *bring* the dragons, as, of course, dragon fire is the best defense against militarized ice. Meanwhile, had any of us expected the Targaryen restoration to be so erotic? How will our heroes find out that they’re nephew and aunt? And how will their dreamy facial expressions change? Will they shrug and say, “[Nobody’s perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mHhr-aaLnI)”? And Jon Snow has such a great name—do we have to call him [Aegon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n63KZH5Un8M) now?\n\nWhat else to expect? Arya, the trailer indicates, knows death’s many faces, and is looking forward to seeing at least one of them. (My money’s on Cersei, still on the kill list.) At and around Winterfell, the Starks will be among the first to deal with the undead, and the siblings may poke around in the crypt; Bran will continue to snoop, eyeballishly, throughout time and space, and we will finally learn whether Sansa’s steadfast shoring-up of grain reserves proves adequate. Gendry, having rowed back into our hearts and onto our screens, will, I assume, try his hand at blacksmithing dragonglass weaponry, and people will eventually find out what a fine regal bastard he is. In Essos and beyond, we will see what eyelinered Pacey Witter, a.k.a. Euron Greyjoy, looks like leading a mercenary army of men, horses, and elephants. We’ll find out whether Theon, Yara, Daario, Melisandre, or other back-burner forces show up unexpectedly to save any number of days; which of Old Nan’s bedtime stories will be most prophetic; and whether Podrick’s surprising lovemaking skills return as a plot point. Qyburn will keep tinkering, like a demented Merlin, and I suspect that somebody, or many somebodies, will be reanimated by fire. Lyanna Mormont will charm us. Battles will groan on at length. And whoever ultimately sits on that spiky, unpleasant sword-throne, the ending will not be a happy one. How could it be? Much of the magic of “Game of Thrones,” despite all of its dragons and necromancy, has always come via its realistic ratio of happiness to suffering—that is to say, a little within a lot—and from characters becoming wiser and worthier, bit by bit.\n\nChief among these character arcs is Jaime’s reshaping by hand loss, humility, and Brienne of Tarth—into something much nobler than a smirking, child-defenestrating sister-shtupper. A series of scenes in the Season 7 finale made his transformation especially vivid. Watching the episode in 2017, when the negotiations in the Dragonpit fell apart after a seemingly hard-line stance that Jon Snow took about truth and lies, I remember being annoyed at his childish-seeming lack of pragmatism. “When enough people make false promises, words stop meaning anything,” Jon says. “Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies. And lies won’t help us in this fight.” Rewatching it this week, after another year and a half of American politics, the speech felt much different: later in the episode, when Cersei reveals that she lied to her fellow-negotiators, and to Jaime, too, we share Jaime’s horror. After all that, it was a joy to watch Jaime turn his back on Cersei and ride north. In Season 8, he promises to “fight for the living” and to keep his promise. *Valar dohaeris*, everybody.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e8836cecf40192143c7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"“Game of Thrones”","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"game-of-thrones"},{"id":"5c2e1fa3425c632c6cd70841","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"TV Recaps","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tv-recaps"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b4a08312cd3aa6c3e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"HBO","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hbo"}],"sections":[{"id":"59fb31b64913327693abedce","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Television","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-television"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a04521c7a8e33fb390c11","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sarah Larson is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

In last night’s Season 7 “[Game of Thrones](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/game-of-thrones-returns-for-season-7)” finale, some things left us a bit unsatisfied—what we’d hoped would be a\nCleganebowl was more like a Clegane side salad—and some things surpassed\nour wildest imaginings. Switcheroos were pulled, sisterhood was\npowerful, a snowflake fell on Jaime’s glove, we warged to the wedding of\nall weddings, love was in the air, and tremendous things were revealed about Jon Snow.\nTremendous *ass* things, specifically. Also, his real name. But first:\ngenitals and a Cold War.\n\nWe open at King’s Landing, where the big parley is upon\nus. Grey Worm and his cast of thousands are standing outside the gates,\nspears aloft. “You wouldn’t find me fighting in an army if I had no\ncock,” Bronn says to Jaime, observing the field of mighty eunuchs. “What’s left to fight for?”\n\nGold? Jaime says, seeming to be guessing. Family? If these philosophical\nresponses have you thinking, Hmm, you are right: they’re\nforeshadowing. “Maybe it really is all cocks in the end,” Jaime says, looking sad. (Cheer up, Jaime: you might have just come up with a new slogan for HBO.) The Dothrakis come swooping in on their horses and with\ntheir mini-scythes. They always have so much *fun* on a rampage.\n\nTyrion arrives on a boat with Varys, Davos Seaworth, Theon, Jon Snow, &\nCompany, and he reminisces about King’s Landing’s high-quality brothels.\nInside the castle, Cersei is saying, Look, everybody, if things get\nnuts, kill ’em in this order: silver-haired bitch; our brother; bastard\nwho calls himself King. Jaime looks uncomfortable, as he has for a few\nyears now. On the approach to the castle, many fond hellos: Pod and\nTyrion; a Lannister soldier and a grunting crate; the Hound and Brienne\nof Tarth, who nearly killed him the last time they saw each other. (“Thought\nyou were dead.” “You came pretty close.” Hey, Arya’s alive! Eh? And just\nlike that, they’re friends. This season is like getting older: suddenly,\neverything happens head-spinningly fast.)\n\nThe Dragonpit at King’s Landing, [formerly a giant Targaryen-dragon stable](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-4-recap-when-they-go-low-we-shoot-fire-from-the-sky), is now in ruins, and might remind us a bit of the Roman\nColosseum. As our heroes grimly file in, nobody murders each other, but\nit’s a real sneer-off. Sandor (the Hound) Clegane mutters darkly as his\nbrother, Gregor (the Mountain) Clegane, a.k.a. Buckethead, thumps in\nalongside Cersei; she’s wearing a high-collared black tunic that\nsuggests a neoprene [Evil Queen Grimhilde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEgZcqlc9ak). Brienne looks\nat Jaime as he passes; Jaime plays it cool, annoying me. Come on, buddy.\nGive us *something!* The Clegane brothers have a whispery staredown,\nwith none of the whispering emerging from the bucket. The reanimated\nMountain isn’t a big talker, and he has a gray face and bleary eyes.\nYes, he’s loyal and steadily employed—but I’m not sure he’s *happy*.\n“You’re even fucking uglier than I am now,” the Hound says. “What did they do to\nyou?” He threatens him, then walks away. We’re saving something for\nSeason 8, perhaps.\n\nIt’s a big, disgruntled gathering of heavyweights: Jaime, Cersei,\nTyrion, Jon Snow, Euron, Theon, just about everybody. This is\nunprecedented—the gang’s all here! But the Dragon Queen is noticeably\nabsent, and Cersei is annoyed by her tardiness. “Didn’t travel with\nyou?” she asks Tyrion. Heh. Cersei, you should know better than to pitch\na softball. Flap! Screech! Drogon, like a reptilian [Spruce Goose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWTk0Uflyk8), swoops down and\nyowls at the assembled, kicking up great clouds of dust. Good morning to you!\n\n“We’ve been here for *some time*,” Cersei says, her jaw set in a\nKellyanne Conway underbite of malice. You think, Ah, let’s get this party started—and\nthen, hilariously, Euron threatens to kill Yara. You know what? Euron is\ngrowing on me. Everyone’s, like, Huh? Who cares about the Greyjoys? Pipe\ndown, pal.\n\nTyrion begins a speech about how they all hate each other but have\nbigger fish to fry. This is Jon Snow’s cue: earnestly [preaching about\nthe dangers of](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-6-recap-you-dont-understand) freaky, horrifying armies of the dead is his bread and\nbutter, and now he has an Exhibit A. “We have something to show you,” he\nsays. The Hound walks up some stairs from the basement with a crate on\nhis back, much like a one-man [lion elevator](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/lion-elevator-restored-romes-gladiator-colosseum-n371376). He opens it: nothing. He kicks it over: quite something. The wight pops\nout, looking extraordinarily disgusting—balding head, prominent\nchoppers, etc.—and, shrieking like a banshee it races straight at Cersei. Friends, my hopes for this\nscene’s comic potential have been more than met. (I hoped he’d mess up her\nThrone Room, knock over some flame vats, maybe drool on the floor map,\nbut fine.) The wight screeches in its chains, making a big show\nof force; Cersei looks scared, which is a truly satisfying delight after\nseven seasons of controlled grimacing. Now we’ve got uncontrolled\ngrimacing. The Hound chops it with his sword; half of the wight’s body crawls and yells, like a [chicken\nwith its head cut off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mzRo8arepA).\nProfessor Snow keeps explaining. “We can destroy them by burning\nthem”—he burns its hand, and it’s just utterly revolting—“and we can\ndestroy them with dragonglass.” Stab. Cersei, wide-eyed, continues to be rattled\nenough that she momentarily stops acting like a shithead. How many are\nthere? Jaime says. A hundred thousand, at least, Dany says. I like\nseeing them all just talk to each other like respectful humans for one\ngoddam minute.\n\nCan it swim? Euron says, stroking its fluffy hair. No? I’m out of here—back to my island! (He hits\non Dany on his way out, for good measure.) Cersei announces that “the\nCrown”—oh, shut up—accepts the proposed truce. It worked! The ridiculous wight\nshow-and-tell plan worked! *Or did it?* Resuming acting like a shithead,\nCersei says that she wants Jon Snow to stay in the North, “where he\nbelongs,” and not take up arms against the Lannisters. Aw, come on. “I\nknow Ned Stark’s son will be true to his word,” she says. She’s a\n*clever* shithead, all right.\n\nJon looks pained. Being noble requires a great deal of wincing. “I\ncannot give you what you ask,” he says. “I cannot serve two queens.”\nHe’s got two knees, but [they can only bend one way](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-3-recap-revenge-served-hot-and-cold). This declaration, of\ncourse, spoils everything, and the Lannisters go off in a huff.\n\n“Fuck loyalty!” Brienne of Tarth says, grabbing Jaime’s arm as he\npasses. Keep going with this, you two. At least make plans to get a\ndrink later.\n\n“Fuck loyalty?” he says. I don’t even *know* you anymore! And yet, on\nanother level, she’s giving him something to think about.\n\nMeanwhile, everybody is mad at Jon Snow, including Jon Snow. Tyrion goes\noff to talk to Cersei alone, followed closely by the Mountain. At this\npoint, we’re wondering when all hell will break loose—sure, some intense\nwords have flown around, and also a dragon, and a wight—but for a season\nfinale, we’ve seen very little true mayhem. I wouldn’t have minded five more\nminutes of Cersei looking terrified as two halves of a balding ghoul\nscampered around the Dragonpit, or maybe jumped into her lap, like\nsomebody’s dog jumping onto a cat person. “He’s just *friendly!*” Jon Snow\ncould have said.\n\nOutside Cersei’s chambers, Jaime and Tyrion jovially agree that they are\nidiots who should say goodbye forever, because their days are numbered;\ninside, Tyrion and Cersei argue, and he dares her to kill him—“You love\nyour family, and I have destroyed it. So put an end to me!” She looks at\nthe Mountain, like, Yeah, sure, go ahead. But the moment ends with\npanting, not death, and Tyrion pours himself some wine. And another\nwine. I threw back a little ice water. This glarefest ends with Tyrion\ndeducing something as his sister gets dreamy. “Maybe Euron Greyjoy had\nthe right idea,” she says. “Get on a boat, take those who matter . . .”\n\n“You’re pregnant!” Tyrion says. *Ugh*. I forgot!\n\nIn the Dragonpit of disgustery, bones scattered around, Dany approaches Jon Snow. Suddenly,\nafter last week’s dragons-and-furs drama, not to mention their Moment in\nthe Cave, they have a vibe. “No one’s less happy about this than I am,”\nhe says. I don’t know, Jon—Tyrion didn’t seem too psyched, either.\n\n“I respect what you did. I wish you hadn’t done it, but I respect it,”\nshe says. So much for her imperious bend-the-knee routine! (As this\nromance further reveals itself, I think, Aha. *Now* I know why they had\nto get rid of Daario. You can’t be married to one Daario and have\nanother Daario on the side. Too many long-haired lusty leerers! And yet,\nI miss Daario.) Dany talks about how this place, where they locked up\nher family’s dragons, was the beginning of the end. This leads,\nnaturally, into her saying she can’t have children. Says who? Jon asks.\n\n“The witch who murdered my husband,” she says. (This is the “[My\nfaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmhGA1qzYTk)” of this episode.)\nJon scoffs. Dany tells him that he was right from the beginning, that she should have trusted him all\nalong. Speaking of the beginning, I wish the writers and directors had\ngiven these two more chemistry from the beginning, and less assholery on\nher part, and more believability in the transition from pride and\nprejudice to love, and not bungled their relationship’s trajectory. On\nthe other hand, here we are. I love tender conversations like this,\nwith two very attractive people being respectful and understanding.\nRowr!\n\nCersei marches out with Jaime and Qyburn and the Mountain, and announces\nthat she will send her armies north to “march beside you.” Remember my\nkindness! she says. But she is up to no good, as usual.\n\nBack at Winterfell, where we’ve endured a few episodes of Petyr\nBaelish-orchestrated sororal unpleasantness, Littlefinger is murmuring\nto Sansa about Arya wanting to murder her. Sansa, acting like a more\nrobotic Robin Arryn, parrots Littlefinger’s ideas back to him as if\nshe’s thought of them herself. What? you might be thinking, cursing this\nplot.\n\nSuddenly: the map table at [Dragonstone](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-1-recap-dragonstone-sweet-dragonstone). Parley over, our heroes have\nzapped home lickety-split. Dany, Jon, Grey Worm, Missandei. (Tonight,\nthere will be lovemaking.) They plot their next moves, and Dany agrees with Jon Snow’s plan. “I’m not coming\nto conquer the North, I’m coming to save the North,” she says. “[We sail together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmUlKPthrag).”\n\nTheon and Jon have an intense chat in the dragon-throne room. Jon’s vibe\nis considerably more at-home than it was the first time we saw him\nthere, with Davos as his interlocutor—now it’s like he owns the place.\nTheon, impressed by Jon’s truthfulness at King’s Landing and feeling guilty about his past, wants to talk about Ned Stark, and about being a\ngood man. “I always wanted to do the right thing, be the right kind of\nperson, but I never knew what that meant,” he says.\n\nJon, a humble, certified good guy, forgives Theon as best he can,\nwhile sternly acknowledging that, yes, he has been very bad. Theon says\nthat [he needs to save Yara](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-2-recap-flaming-ships-and-demented-laughter); she’s the only one who tried to save him\nfrom Ramsay. Well, scoot, then! Jon says. On the beach, with his crew,\nTheon finds it’s not so easy being a Jon Snow; when he proposes saving\nYara, he gets into a bloody fight that culminates in a bunch of knee\njabs to his groin. Well, joke’s on you—Theon *has* no groin. His\njunklessness, long tragic, is suddenly like a secret superpower, and\nhe’s able to turn the fight around. “For Yara!” he yells.\n\n“Yara!” the rest of the men yell. “Game of Thrones” has done wonders\nfor eunuchs and other genitally marginalized gents.\n\nAt Winterfell, Sansa orders her sister to be brought to the Great Hall,\nand I am ordering my eyebrows not to be glared off. Arya stands before\nSansa, and Littlefinger smirks.\n\nSansa declares that she is defending her family “from those who would\nharm us” and the North “from those who would betray us.” Get on with it, then, Arya says. “You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason,” Sansa says, coldly. “How do you answer these charges—Lord Baelish?” Whoa, ho,\nho! At this moment, my neighbors learned what it sounds like in my\napartment when they are watching the Super Bowl: loud, delirious\nbellowing and overjoyed profanity.\n\nNow Arya’s smirking. “My sister asked you a question,” she says. Littlefinger looks startled. My outburst goes up a\nlevel.\n\nThe sisters continue laying out their case against Littlefinger—a very\ngood case, as you recall. Littlefinger protests: you little creeps saw nothing! Then Three-Eyed Bran pipes up: he saw him betray Ned Stark. “You held a knife to his throat,” he says. It’s spectacular. Stark-kid powers,\nactivate! Littlefinger is alarmed; he cries; Sansa uses Littlefinger’s\nown words of manipulation on him. It’s all quite wonderful. I had\nwondered a while ago, when Arya the Spy was creeping around, whether her\ndiscovering the note he laid as a trap for her was double-crossing his\ndouble-cross. But ever since then, when we saw what appeared to be the\nStark sisters just flat-out fighting with each other in otherwise empty\nhallways and rooms, we were led to believe that they had actually fallen\nfor his tricks, which didn’t make sense and didn’t feel true to\ncharacter. So, despite my intense gladness about the Stark-sib unity, I\nalso found myself thinking of the 1998 Matt Dillon–Neve Campbell movie\n“[Wild Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6DsFyC9l-U),” whose plot\nincluded a manipulative twist so ridiculous it felt like flat-out cheating,\nand which has remained my standard for plot-revelation unfairness ever\nsince. But, unlike “Wild Things,” we arrive at a kind of justice. Arya\nslashes Littlefinger’s throat—be careful with his cute face, you might need\nit!—and he dies on the floor. Thank you for your service, Lord Baelish:\nold Lurk-n-Smirk is no longer. Well governed, Stark kids.\n\nNot all families can stick together so effectively. At King’s Landing,\nSer Jaime is at the floor map, talking to his men about trains and Lord\nHarroway’s Town and fortnights. (Babe, *nothing* takes a fortnight in\nWesteros anymore.) Cersei wants a word. “Expedition north?” she says.\n“Are you a traitor, or an idiot?” She goes on with her usual\nbaloney. He is incredulous; I am not. I was incredulous when she made a\nlick of sense. She talks about gold and elephants—a mercenary army in\nEssos they can afford with their new Highgarden money. *Euron* is up for\nit, she says. Why can’t you be? Everybody’s double-crossin’!\n\nYou plotted with Euron? Jaime says. Cersei bangs on about Jaime’s\nplotting with Tyrion. This escalates, like her fight with Tyrion; this\nfight, too, results in a death threat. The Mountain begins to move.\n*No!* I shout.\n\n“I don’t believe you,” Jaime says, and leaves. She does not kill him.\nI’m baffled but relieved; Cersei looks pained, a bit torn. I mean, look.\nYou only get one lover/twin in a lifetime. Next, we see Jaime alone,\nriding his horse under a darkening sky. Where to, friend? A snowflake\nfalls on his glove. We see a closeup of dead wight parts in the\nDragonpit; the burned ruins of the city; snow on the map floor;\ndarkness. Meet the good guys at Winterfell, my chum, and join in the pleasures of wight-fighting! I’m already imagining a Tormund-Jaime-Brienne three-way eyeballing in the North.\n\nBran Three-Eyes, by a fireplace, gets a visit from Sam Tarly, and,\nunderstandably, he livens up a bit. “Samwell Tarly!” he says.\n\n“I wasn’t sure if you’d remember me!” Sam says. I remember everything,\nBran says. I’m the Three-Eyed Raven!\n\n“Oh!” Sam says, nodding, making a surprised I-know-what-that-means face. “I don't know what\nthat means,” he admits. He is just wonderful.\n\nBran really opens up with Sam around. “Jon isn’t really my father’s\nson,” he says. “He’s the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt Lyanna\nStark.” You’d think he’d tell his siblings some of this stuff. Maybe\nthey don’t ask? Jon was born in Dorne, he goes on. His last name isn’t\nreally Snow; it’s Sand—\n\nHold up, Sam says. Suddenly, he, too remembers everything, including the\npart of the High Septon’s private diary [he seemed to be ignoring a few episodes ago](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/sarah-larson/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-5-recap-the-book-of-love), when Gilly read it aloud. No\nmatter: we’ve got a wedding to warg to. Soon we’re under a tree in\nDorne, at the secret wedding of R. and L. Rhaegar looks very similar to\nViserys, Daenerys’s other brother, the repulsive maniac—and they both\nlook like [King Einon](http://dragonheart.wikia.com/wiki/File:Dragonheart-einon-david-thewlis.png) in “Dragonheart.” But love is love, I suppose. I’m expecting this “Mother, maiden, crone, stranger” vow to creep into American weddings in 2018.\n\n“Robert’s Rebellion was built on a lie!” Bran says. “He loved her!”\nWe’ve known this for a while, but it’s nice to have it spelled out, I\nsuppose.\n\nMeanwhile—shudder—Jon knocks on Dany’s bedroom door, with a look of Jon\nSnow earnest determination, which is similar to a Jon Snow look of\nlust. I know that last week I announced that I wanted these two to have\nsex, but now I realize that I should have specified that I didn’t want\nthis to happen intercut with scenes of the bloody rags from his birth\nand an incest voice-over. Once again, we see the birth scene, and an\nN.P.H.-looking young Ned Stark at Lyanna’s bedside, and her whispering\nto him. Jon’s real name, we learn, is Aegon Targaryen. “You have to protect him,” Lyanna whispers.\nWe learn this *as Jon and Dany are about to do it*. Ugh! “He’s never\nbeen a bastard, he’s the heir to the Iron Throne,” Bran says, mildly. Schtup schtup. Once\nagain, I feel like Evelyn Quince on “[Tales of Ribaldry](http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/tales-of-ribaldry/n9700?snl=1)”—this\nis not quite the ribaldry I had hoped for. I don’t care if it’s the\nTargaryen way!\n\nThe lovemaking continues. He flips her over. Behold! Aegon Targaryen has\na spectacular ass. As we watch these two or more plotlines converge,\nbutt dimples and all, we might try to squint through our confused\nrepulsion to see through to our fondness for these gorgeous people, and\nthe, er, goodness of their mission. A Targaryen restoration, indeed.\n\nAt Winterfell, other relatives are behaving more reasonably. “ Are you\nall right?” Arya asks Sansa, post-Baelish. “You did the right thing.”\n\n“You did it,” Sansa says.\n\n“I’m just the executioner,” Arya says, humbly. Aw, guys! So sweet! I love when\nyou’re getting along. To double down on reassuring us that they were\njust tricking us in the last couple of episodes, Arya tells Sansa that\nshe never could have survived what Sansa survived, and Sansa tells her\nthat Arya is the strongest person she knows. Arya is touched. “Don’t get\nused to it,” Sansa says. “You’re still very strange and annoying.” I am\nso relieved by this, but I am still annoyed by the “Wild Things”-style\ntrickery. Sansa and Arya should never be reminding me of Kevin Bacon and\nNeve Campbell, and that’s final.\n\nBran is cooling out with his friend the tree, eyeballs aloft. Where is he off to this\ntime? The Wall, that’s where—with cawing. In the\nlookout, Beric and Tormund peer into the distance. In a final scene\nthat many of us expected, we see dead soldiers marching, led by White Walkers\non creepy horses, and our icky uptown dragon, the newly blue-eyed\nViserion, flaps in and breathes blue flame on the Wall, like some\nkind of supercharged [York Peppermint Pattie\ncommercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYJl-IAQXvE). “Run!” Tormund\nsays. Tormund, my darling, godspeed. (“I hope Tormund survived the\nSterno-can fire!” a friend wrote.) The show’s composer, [Ramin Djawadi](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/music-is-coming-game-of-thrones-live-at-madison-square-garden),\ntries his hand at something vaguely Wagnerian. The Night King is riding\nViserion, which feels like an affront; so does the uncomfortable\nsensation of watching this scene, which quickly feels like a kind of ice\n9/11. The Wall falls, with great clouds of smoky ice; the Army of the\nDead marches south. When “Game of Thrones” returns, in 2064, will there\nbe light enough to see where they go? Will more snow fall on Jaime’s\nhand? How many Targaryens and Lannisters will there be? (And how are we\nsupposed to feel about incest?) The Long Night will be upon them;\nmeanwhile, let’s hope we make it through ours.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"5907ef01ebe912338a371720","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a04521c7a8e33fb390c11","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sarah Larson is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

The [Green New Deal](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/a-baffling-week-for-climate-policy-on-the-hill) is on our minds, Earth Day is coming up, and two of my podcast recommendations this month are about the environment and what we’ve done to it. On Monday in Podcast Dept., I reviewed “[Richest Hill](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/podcast-dept/richest-hill-a-must-listen-podcast-about-butte-montana),” an excellent new series from Montana Public Radio about Butte, the feisty former copper boom town and Superfund hot spot. As the series begins, Nora Saks, its reporter and host, tells us that she falls asleep every night to the sound of the Phoenix Wailer—a car-alarm-like mechanical whooping outside. Its function, we later learn, is to scare birds away from a massive toxic lake, the Berkeley Pit, which we visit with binoculars. It’s not easy to tell an enjoyable story about pollution, but, so far, Saks pulls it off, with well-paced scenes, delightful characters, and unexpected sounds: an air cannon, labor-union members singing “Solidarity Forever,” an Irish wake called Hope for the Snow Geese, the firing-up of a long-dormant copper-hoisting engine, lots of glorious fiddling. The series will trace, in real time, the progress of a momentous Superfund deal that aims to clean up Butte for good.    \n \n“[Drilled](https://www.criticalfrequency.org/drilled),” a podcast reported and hosted by the journalist Amy Westervelt, provides a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the secret history of climate-change denial. It begins with a startling story about how Exxon planned, in the nineteen-seventies, to create a well-funded research arm that would do for the energy industry what Bell Labs had done for communications—and would help innovate solutions to climate change. Ed Garvey, a former Exxon scientist, says that, at Exxon in the seventies, “The issue was not *were* we going to have a problem” with global warming but “how soon and how fast and how bad was it going to be.” In the episodes that follow, the story of how climate denial came to replace innovation as the prevailing strategy in boardrooms, on Capitol Hill, and in op-ed pages during the Reagan era and beyond plays out like a true-crime narrative, and rightly so.    \n \nThe climate is changing in Westeros, too, and it’s time to brush up on our Dothraki—this month [“Game of Thrones](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/game-of-thrones)” returns, once and for all. In “Verisimilitude,” a recent episode of Helen Zaltzman’s venerable and linguistically zesty podcast “[The Allusionist](https://www.theallusionist.org/),” Zaltzman talks with David Peterson, who created Dothraki and Valyrian—“functional languages with large vocabularies and complex grammars and etymologies”—for the HBO series. Her aim is to find out “what it takes to make a fictional language sound realistic, even when the speaker is riding on a dragon.” In the course of their conversation, Peterson describes building on what George R. R. Martin came up with in the “Song of Ice and Fire” novels, somewhat wistfully contrasts Dothraki’s popularity with that of Klingon and explains why the word “Khaleesi” became “just a real thorn in my side.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7c36cecf40192141d6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Environment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"environment"},{"id":"5c2e1c78b75f002c8941e46a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Podcasts","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"podcasts"},{"id":"5c2e1e8836cecf40192143c7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"“Game of Thrones”","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"game-of-thrones"}],"sections":[{"id":"595424eb7d94e97fee0c6087","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Podcast Dept.","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"podcast-dept"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a04521c7a8e33fb390c11","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sarah Larson is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.
