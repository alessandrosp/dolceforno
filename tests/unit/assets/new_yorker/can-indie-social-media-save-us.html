class="ArticleBody__articleBody___1GSGP"><div><div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>In <span data-page="page_1"></span>the summer of 2016, I gave a talk at a small <em class="small">TED</em>x conference in northern Virginia. I began by admitting that I’ve never had a social-media account; I then outlined arguments for why other people should consider eliminating social media from their lives. The event organizers uploaded the video of my talk to <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/youtube">YouTube</a>, where it languished for a few months. Then, for unknowable reasons, it entered the viral slipstream. It was shared repeatedly on <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/facebook">Facebook</a> and <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/instagram">Instagram</a> and, eventually, viewed more than five million times. I was both pleased and chagrined by the irony of the fact that my anti-social-media talk had found such a large audience on social media.</p><p>I think of this episode as typical of the conflicted relationships many of us have with Facebook, Instagram, and other social-media platforms. On the one hand, we’ve grown wary of the so-called attention economy, which, in the name of corporate profits, exploits our psychological vulnerabilities in ways that corrode social life, diminish privacy, weaken civic cohesion, and make us vulnerable to manipulation. But we also benefit from social media and hesitate to disengage from it completely. Not long ago, I met a partner at a large law firm in Washington, D.C., who told me that she keeps Instagram on her phone because she misses her kids when she travels; browsing pictures of them makes her feel better. Meanwhile, because she also worries about her phone usage, she’s instituted a rule that requires her, before looking at Instagram, to read for at least thirty minutes. Last year, she read fifty-five books. Many of us have similar stories. Even as we dream of abandoning social media, we search for ways to redeem it.</p><p>In recent months, some of the biggest social-media companies have begun searching for this redemption, too. Facebook and <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/twitter">Twitter</a>, in particular, have promised various reforms. In March, Mark Zuckerberg <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/mark-zuckerbergs-plans-to-capitalize-on-facebooks-failures">announced a plan</a> to move his platform toward private communication protected by end-to-end encryption; later that month, he proposed the establishment of a third-party group to set standards for acceptable content. Around the same time, <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/jack-dorseys-ted-interview-and-the-end-of-an-era">Jack Dorsey</a> brought one of Twitter’s head lawyers onto Joe Rogan’s podcast to better explain the platform’s evolving standards for banning users. Legislators are also getting involved. Elizabeth Warren shared a plan for <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/mark-zuckerberg-elizabeth-warren-and-the-case-for-regulating-big-tech">breaking up tech giants</a> like Facebook; others admire the European Union’s sweeping and byzantine General Data Protection Regulation, which deploys aggressive fines to coerce companies into better protecting user privacy.</p><p>All of these approaches assume that the reformation of social media will be an intricate, lengthy, and incremental process involving lawyers, Ph.D.s, and government experts. But not everyone sees it that way. Alongside these official responses, a loose collective of developers and techno-utopians that calls itself the IndieWeb has been creating another alternative. The movement’s affiliates are developing their own social-media platforms, which they say will preserve what’s good about social media while jettisoning what’s bad. They hope to rebuild social media according to principles that are less corporate and more humane.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Proponents of the IndieWeb offer a fairly straightforward analysis of our current social-media crisis. They frame it in terms of a single question: Who owns the servers? The bulk of our online activity takes places on servers owned by a small number of massive companies. Servers cost money to run. If you’re using a company’s servers without paying for the privilege, then that company must be finding other ways to “extract value” from you—and it’s that quest for large-scale value extraction, they argue, that leads directly to the crises of compromised privacy and engineered addictiveness with which we’re currently grappling.</p><p>In their view, freedom of expression is also affected by server ownership. When you confine your online activities to so-called walled-garden networks, you end up using interfaces that benefit the owners of those networks; on social media, this means that you are forced to choose among what the techno-philosopher Jaron Lanier has called “multiple-choice identities.” According to this way of thinking, sites like Facebook and Instagram encourage conformism because it makes your data easier to process and monetize. This creates the exhausting sense that you’re a worker in a data factory rather than a three-dimensional individual trying to express yourself and connect with other real people in an organic way online.</p><p>When the problem is framed this way, the solution promoted by the IndieWeb movement becomes obvious: own your own servers. On a smaller scale, this is an old idea. For the past twelve years, I’ve hosted my personal blog using a server that I lease in a Michigan data center; I’ve enjoyed knowing that I own what I post there and that no one is trying to monetize my data or exploit my attention. And yet, running a personal blog that you write yourself is quite different from running a social network. To create social platforms that work on servers owned by users rather than big corporations, the IndieWeb developers have had to solve a tricky technical problem: decentralization.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>In 2017, Manton Reece, an IndieWeb developer based in Austin, Texas, launched a Kickstarter for a service called Micro.blog. On its surface, Micro.blog looks a lot like Twitter or Instagram; you can follow users and see their posts sorted into a time line, and, if you like a post, you can send a reply that everyone can see. When I checked Micro.blog’s public time<span data-page="page_2"></span> line recently, the top post was a picture of a blooming dogwood tree, with the caption “Spring is coming!”</p><div class=""

a familiar interface, though, everyone posting to Micro.blog does so on his or her own domain hosted on Micro.blog’s server or on their own personal server. Reece’s software acts as an aggregator, facilitating a sense of community and gathering users’ content so that it can be seen on a single screen. Users own what they write and can do whatever they want with it—including post it, simultaneously, to other competing aggregators. IndieWeb developers argue that this system—which they call <em class="small">POSSE</em>, for “publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere”—encourages competition and innovation while allowing users to vote with their feet. If Reece were to begin aggressively harvesting user data, or if another service were to start offering richer features, users could shift their attention from one aggregator to another with little effort. They wouldn’t be trapped on a platform that owns everything they’ve written and is doing everything it can to exploit their data and attention.</p><p>Mastodon, another popular IndieWeb service, exists in the middle ground between centralized and decentralized social media. Founded, in 2016, by a young programmer named Eugen Rochko, Mastodon offers an experience similar to the one available on existing social-media platforms: after setting up an account on a Mastodon server—called an “instance”—one can post and browse text and images presented in a chronological time line. What distinguishes Mastodon is that anyone can download the software and begin running their own instance. When you set up an account with Mastodon, you do so on a specific instance that becomes your home; you see the posts of others users on your home instance, and they see yours. Together, the independent instances make up a “federation.” A “federation protocol” allows independent instances to talk with each other, so that a user with an account on infosec.exchange, say—“a Mastodon instance for info/cyber-security-minded people”—can follow updates from a user on queer.party. Most Mastodon users, however, tend to focus their online interactions on a small number of instances representing communities to which they feel a strong connection.</p><p>Each Mastodon instance can set its own rules about formats, acceptable speech, privacy, and other issues. The rules of the infosec.exchange instance, for example, emphasize civility (“don’t be a jerk”), while the queer.party instance allows not-safe-for-work content. As Rochko explains on his Patreon page, this model aims to return “control of the content distribution channels to the people.”</p><p>Because most Mastodon instances are small—typically, each numbers a couple of thousand users—and crowdfunded by their members, they feel different from mass social media, with an enticing free-form energy reminiscent of the Internet’s early days. The contrast between this atmosphere and the one found on existing social networks is striking. Thanks to its cavernous scale and the dynamics of retweet-driven virality, Twitter has devolved into a place where users seem desperate for attention, shouting at influencers and competing to see whose snark is most cutting. Mastodon, at least for now, is a human-scale environment in which users are happy to chat about quirky things with other quirky people. Recently, when I logged into the Mastodon instance sunbeam.city—a “Libertarian Socialist solarpunk instance”—I found a photo of someone’s blooming spider plant next to a conversation about the consequences of ethical transparency in hierarchical systems. It struck me as the quintessential early-Internet experience.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Could the IndieWeb movement—or a streamlined, user-friendly version of it to come—succeed in redeeming the promise of social media? If we itemize the woes currently afflicting the major platforms, there’s a strong case to be made that the IndieWeb avoids them. When social-media servers aren’t controlled by a small number of massive public companies, the incentive to exploit users diminishes. The homegrown, community-oriented feel of the IndieWeb is superior to the vibe of anxious narcissism that’s degrading existing services. And, in a sense, decentralization also helps solve the problem of content moderation. One reason Mark Zuckerberg has called for the establishment of a third-party moderation organization is, presumably, that he’s realized how difficult it is to come up with a single set of guidelines capable of satisfying over a billion users; the IndieWeb would allow many different standards to emerge, trusting users to gravitate toward the ones that work for them. Decentralization still provides corners in which dark ideas can fester, but knowing that there’s a neo-Nazi Mastodon instance out there somewhere may be preferable to encountering neo-Nazis in your Twitter mentions. The Internet may work better when it’s spread out, as originally designed.</p><p>Despite its advantages, however, I suspect that the IndieWeb will not succeed in replacing existing social-media platforms at their current scale. For one thing, the IndieWeb lacks the carefully engineered addictiveness that helped fuel the rise of services like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This addictiveness has kept people returning to their devices even when they know there are better uses for their time; remove the addiction, and you might lose the users.</p><p>It may be, too, that people who are uneasy about social media aren’t looking for a better version of it but are instead ready to permanently reduce the role that smartphone screens play in their lives. Many of those who flocked to social media out of a sense of exuberance or experimentation are now losing interest. Some are people my age, who signed up for<span data-page="page_final"></span> services like Facebook in college but now have families and responsibilities in their real-world communities and find the obligation to like posts or comment on photos increasingly superfluous. Others are older people who tried social media later in life, when it seemed like the thing to do, but now doubt that it’s worth the effort. Increasing numbers of teen-agers are rejecting the ceaseless pressure for digital performance; in March, Edison Research released a report claiming that young people made up the largest share of the fifteen million users Facebook has lost since 2017. To be sixteen and offline has become countercultural.</p><p>At the end of my <em class="small">TED</em>x talk, I note that people often ask me what life is like without social media. By way of an answer, I project a photograph of a bench overlooking a quiet pastoral landscape. As a technology enthusiast, I’m a believer in the IndieWeb movement and think it will play an important role in the future of the Internet. For the exhausted majority of social-media users, however, the appeal of the proverbial quiet bench might outweigh the lure of a better Facebook. In this vision of the future, there will be many more social-media platforms but far fewer people spending significant time on any of them. Social media has reshaped our culture, and this has convinced us that it is fundamentally appealing. Strip away its most manipulative elements, though, and we may find that it’s less rewarding than it seems.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ"><div

of 2016, I gave a talk at a small ",["em",{"class":"small"},"TED"],"x conference in northern Virginia. I began by admitting that I’ve never had a social-media account; I then outlined arguments for why other people should consider eliminating social media from their lives. The event organizers uploaded the video of my talk to ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/youtube"},"YouTube"],", where it languished for a few months. Then, for unknowable reasons, it entered the viral slipstream. It was shared repeatedly on ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/facebook"},"Facebook"]," and ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/instagram"},"Instagram"]," and, eventually, viewed more than five million times. I was both pleased and chagrined by the irony of the fact that my anti-social-media talk had found such a large audience on social media."],["p","I think of this episode as typical of the conflicted relationships many of us have with Facebook, Instagram, and other social-media platforms. On the one hand, we’ve grown wary of the so-called attention economy, which, in the name of corporate profits, exploits our psychological vulnerabilities in ways that corrode social life, diminish privacy, weaken civic cohesion, and make us vulnerable to manipulation. But we also benefit from social media and hesitate to disengage from it completely. Not long ago, I met a partner at a large law firm in Washington, D.C., who told me that she keeps Instagram on her phone because she misses her kids when she travels; browsing pictures of them makes her feel better. Meanwhile, because she also worries about her phone usage, she’s instituted a rule that requires her, before looking at Instagram, to read for at least thirty minutes. Last year, she read fifty-five books. Many of us have similar stories. Even as we dream of abandoning social media, we search for ways to redeem it."],["p","In recent months, some of the biggest social-media companies have begun searching for this redemption, too. Facebook and ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/twitter"},"Twitter"],", in particular, have promised various reforms. In March, Mark Zuckerberg ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/mark-zuckerbergs-plans-to-capitalize-on-facebooks-failures"},"announced a plan"]," to move his platform toward private communication protected by end-to-end encryption; later that month, he proposed the establishment of a third-party group to set standards for acceptable content. Around the same time, ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/jack-dorseys-ted-interview-and-the-end-of-an-era"},"Jack Dorsey"]," brought one of Twitter’s head lawyers onto Joe Rogan’s podcast to better explain the platform’s evolving standards for banning users. Legislators are also getting involved. Elizabeth Warren shared a plan for ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/mark-zuckerberg-elizabeth-warren-and-the-case-for-regulating-big-tech"},"breaking up tech giants"]," like Facebook; others admire the European Union’s sweeping and byzantine General Data Protection Regulation, which deploys aggressive fines to coerce companies into better protecting user privacy."],["p","All of these approaches assume that the reformation of social media will be an intricate, lengthy, and incremental process involving lawyers, Ph.D.s, and government experts. But not everyone sees it that way. Alongside these official responses, a loose collective of developers and techno-utopians that calls itself the IndieWeb has been creating another alternative. The movement’s affiliates are developing their own social-media platforms, which they say will preserve what’s good about social media while jettisoning what’s bad. They hope to rebuild social media according to principles that are less corporate and more humane."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EProponents%20of%20the%20IndieWeb%20offer%20a%20fairly%20straightforward%20analysis%20of%20our%20current%20social-media%20crisis.%20They%20frame%20it%20in%20terms%20of%20a%20single%20question%3A%20Who%20owns%20the%20servers%3F%20The%20bulk%20of%20our%20online%20activity%20takes%20places%20on%20servers%20owned%20by%20a%20small%20number%20of%20massive%20companies.%20Servers%20cost%20money%20to%20run.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20using%20a%20company%E2%80%99s%20servers%20without%20paying%20for%20the%20privilege%2C%20then%20that%20company%20must%20be%20finding%20other%20ways%20to%20%E2%80%9Cextract%20value%E2%80%9D%20from%20you%E2%80%94and%20it%E2%80%99s%20that%20quest%20for%20large-scale%20value%20extraction%2C%20they%20argue%2C%20that%20leads%20directly%20to%20the%20crises%20of%20compromised%20privacy%20and%20engineered%20addictiveness%20with%20which%20we%E2%80%99re%20currently%20grappling.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20their%20view%2C%20freedom%20of%20expression%20is%20also%20affected%20by%20server%20ownership.%20When%20you%20confine%20your%20online%20activities%20to%20so-called%20walled-garden%20networks%2C%20you%20end%20up%20using%20interfaces%20that%20benefit%20the%20owners%20of%20those%20networks%3B%20on%20social%20media%2C%20this%20means%20that%20you%20are%20forced%20to%20choose%20among%20what%20the%20techno-philosopher%20Jaron%20Lanier%20has%20called%20%E2%80%9Cmultiple-choice%20identities.%E2%80%9D%20According%20to%20this%20way%20of%20thinking%2C%20sites%20like%20Facebook%20and%20Instagram%20encourage%20conformism%20because%20it%20makes%20your%20data%20easier%20to%20process%20and%20monetize.%20This%20creates%20the%20exhausting%20sense%20that%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20worker%20in%20a%20data%20factory%20rather%20than%20a%20three-dimensional%20individual%20trying%20to%20express%20yourself%20and%20connect%20with%20other%20real%20people%20in%20an%20organic%20way%20online.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWhen%20the%20problem%20is%20framed%20this%20way%2C%20the%20solution%20promoted%20by%20the%20IndieWeb%20movement%20becomes%20obvious%3A%20own%20your%20own%20servers.%20On%20a%20smaller%20scale%2C%20this%20is%20an%20old%20idea.%20For%20the%20past%20twelve%20years%2C%20I%E2%80%99ve%20hosted%20my%20personal%20blog%20using%20a%20server%20that%20I%20lease%20in%20a%20Michigan%20data%20center%3B%20I%E2%80%99ve%20enjoyed%20knowing%20that%20I%20own%20what%20I%20post%20there%20and%20that%20no%20one%20is%20trying%20to%20monetize%20my%20data%20or%20exploit%20my%20attention.%20And%20yet%2C%20running%20a%20personal%20blog%20that%20you%20write%20yourself%20is%20quite%20different%20from%20running%20a%20social%20network.%20To%20create%20social%20platforms%20that%20work%20on%20servers%20owned%20by%20users%20rather%20than%20big%20corporations%2C%20the%20IndieWeb%20developers%20have%20had%20to%20solve%20a%20tricky%20technical%20problem%3A%20decentralization.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","Proponents of the IndieWeb offer a fairly straightforward analysis of our current social-media crisis. They frame it in terms of a single question: Who owns the servers? The bulk of our online activity takes places on servers owned by a small number of massive companies. Servers cost money to run. If you’re using a company’s servers without paying for the privilege, then that company must be finding other ways to “extract value” from you—and it’s that quest for large-scale value extraction, they argue, that leads directly to the crises of compromised privacy and engineered addictiveness with which we’re currently grappling."],["p","In their view, freedom of expression is also affected by server ownership. When you confine your online activities to so-called walled-garden networks, you end up using interfaces that benefit the owners of those networks; on social media, this means that you are forced to choose among what the techno-philosopher Jaron Lanier has called “multiple-choice identities.” According to this way of thinking, sites like Facebook and Instagram encourage conformism because it makes your data easier to process and monetize. This creates the exhausting sense that you’re a worker in a data factory rather than a three-dimensional individual trying to express yourself and connect with other real people in an organic way online."],["p","When the problem is framed this way, the solution promoted by the IndieWeb movement becomes obvious: own your own servers. On a smaller scale, this is an old idea. For the past twelve years, I’ve hosted my personal blog using a server that I lease in a Michigan data center; I’ve enjoyed knowing that I own what I post there and that no one is trying to monetize my data or exploit my attention.

Reece’s software acts as an aggregator, facilitating a sense of community and gathering users’ content so that it can be seen on a single screen. Users own what they write and can do whatever they want with it—including post it, simultaneously, to other competing aggregators. IndieWeb developers argue that this system—which they call ",["em",{"class":"small"},"POSSE"],", for “publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere”—encourages competition and innovation while allowing users to vote with their feet. If Reece were to begin aggressively harvesting user data, or if another service were to start offering richer features, users could shift their attention from one aggregator to another with little effort. They wouldn’t be trapped on a platform that owns everything they’ve written and is doing everything it can to exploit their data and attention."],["p","Mastodon, another popular IndieWeb service, exists in the middle ground between centralized and decentralized social media. Founded, in 2016, by a young programmer named Eugen Rochko, Mastodon offers an experience similar to the one available on existing social-media platforms: after setting up an account on a Mastodon server—called an “instance”—one can post and browse text and images presented in a chronological time line. What distinguishes Mastodon is that anyone can download the software and begin running their own instance. When you set up an account with Mastodon, you do so on a specific instance that becomes your home; you see the posts of others users on your home instance, and they see yours. Together, the independent instances make up a “federation.” A “federation protocol” allows independent instances to talk with each other, so that a user with an account on infosec.exchange, say—“a Mastodon instance for info/cyber-security-minded people”—can follow updates from a user on queer.party. Most Mastodon users, however, tend to focus their online interactions on a small number of instances representing communities to which they feel a strong connection."],["p","Each Mastodon instance can set its own rules about formats, acceptable speech, privacy, and other issues. The rules of the infosec.exchange instance, for example, emphasize civility (“don’t be a jerk”), while the queer.party instance allows not-safe-for-work content. As Rochko explains on his Patreon page, this model aims to return “control of the content distribution channels to the people.”"],["p","Because most Mastodon instances are small—typically, each numbers a couple of thousand users—and crowdfunded by their members, they feel different from mass social media, with an enticing free-form energy reminiscent of the Internet’s early days. The contrast between this atmosphere and the one found on existing social networks is striking. Thanks to its cavernous scale and the dynamics of retweet-driven virality, Twitter has devolved into a place where users seem desperate for attention, shouting at influencers and competing to see whose snark is most cutting. Mastodon, at least for now, is a human-scale environment in which users are happy to chat about quirky things with other quirky people. Recently, when I logged into the Mastodon instance sunbeam.city—a “Libertarian Socialist solarpunk instance”—I found a photo of someone’s blooming spider plant next to a conversation about the consequences of ethical transparency in hierarchical systems. It struck me as the quintessential early-Internet experience."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3ECould%20the%20IndieWeb%20movement%E2%80%94or%20a%20streamlined%2C%20user-friendly%20version%20of%20it%20to%20come%E2%80%94succeed%20in%20redeeming%20the%20promise%20of%20social%20media%3F%20If%20we%20itemize%20the%20woes%20currently%20afflicting%20the%20major%20platforms%2C%20there%E2%80%99s%20a%20strong%20case%20to%20be%20made%20that%20the%20IndieWeb%20avoids%20them.%20When%20social-media%20servers%20aren%E2%80%99t%20controlled%20by%20a%20small%20number%20of%20massive%20public%20companies%2C%20the%20incentive%20to%20exploit%20users%20diminishes.%20The%20homegrown%2C%20community-oriented%20feel%20of%20the%20IndieWeb%20is%20superior%20to%20the%20vibe%20of%20anxious%20narcissism%20that%E2%80%99s%20degrading%20existing%20services.%20And%2C%20in%20a%20sense%2C%20decentralization%20also%20helps%20solve%20the%20problem%20of%20content%20moderation.%20One%20reason%20Mark%20Zuckerberg%20has%20called%20for%20the%20establishment%20of%20a%20third-party%20moderation%20organization%20is%2C%20presumably%2C%20that%20he%E2%80%99s%20realized%20how%20difficult%20it%20is%20to%20come%20up%20with%20a%20single%20set%20of%20guidelines%20capable%20of%20satisfying%20over%20a%20billion%20users%3B%20the%20IndieWeb%20would%20allow%20many%20different%20standards%20to%20emerge%2C%20trusting%20users%20to%20gravitate%20toward%20the%20ones%20that%20work%20for%20them.%20Decentralization%20still%20provides%20corners%20in%20which%20dark%20ideas%20can%20fester%2C%20but%20knowing%20that%20there%E2%80%99s%20a%20neo-Nazi%20Mastodon%20instance%20out%20there%20somewhere%20may%20be%20preferable%20to%20encountering%20neo-Nazis%20in%20your%20Twitter%20mentions.%20The%20Internet%20may%20work%20better%20when%20it%E2%80%99s%20spread%20out%2C%20as%20originally%20designed.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EDespite%20its%20advantages%2C%20however%2C%20I%20suspect%20that%20the%20IndieWeb%20will%20not%20succeed%20in%20replacing%20existing%20social-media%20platforms%20at%20their%20current%20scale.%20For%20one%20thing%2C%20the%20IndieWeb%20lacks%20the%20carefully%20engineered%20addictiveness%20that%20helped%20fuel%20the%20rise%20of%20services%20like%20Facebook%2C%20Twitter%2C%20and%20Instagram.%20This%20addictiveness%20has%20kept%20people%20returning%20to%20their%20devices%20even%20when%20they%20know%20there%20are%20better%20uses%20for%20their%20time%3B%20remove%20the%20addiction%2C%20and%20you%20might%20lose%20the%20users.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIt%20may%20be%2C%20too%2C%20that%20people%20who%20are%20uneasy%20about%20social%20media%20aren%E2%80%99t%20looking%20for%20a%20better%20version%20of%20it%20but%20are%20instead%20ready%20to%20permanently%20reduce%20the%20role%20that%20smartphone%20screens%20play%20in%20their%20lives.%20Many%20of%20those%20who%20flocked%20to%20social%20media%20out%20of%20a%20sense%20of%20exuberance%20or%20experimentation%20are%20now%20losing%20interest.%20Some%20are%20people%20my%20age%2C%20who%20signed%20up%20for%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22analytics%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522analytics%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522final%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%20services%20like%20Facebook%20in%20college%20but%20now%20have%20families%20and%20responsibilities%20in%20their%20real-world%20communities%20and%20find%20the%20obligation%20to%20like%20posts%20or%20comment%20on%20photos%20increasingly%20superfluous.%20Others%20are%20older%20people%20who%20tried%20social%20media%20later%20in%20life%2C%20when%20it%20seemed%20like%20the%20thing%20to%20do%2C%20but%20now%20doubt%20that%20it%E2%80%99s%20worth%20the%20effort.%20Increasing%20numbers%20of%20teen-agers%20are%20rejecting%20the%20ceaseless%20pressure%20for%20digital%20performance%3B%20in%20March%2C%20Edison%20Research%20released%20a%20report%20claiming%20that%20young%20people%20made%20up%20the%20largest%20share%20of%20the%20fifteen%20million%20users%20Facebook%20has%20lost%20since%202017.%20To%20be%20sixteen%20and%20offline%20has%20become%20countercultural.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAt%20the%20end%20of%20my%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3ETED%3C%2Fem%3Ex%20talk%2C%20I%20note%20that%20people%20often%20ask%20me%20what%20life%20is%20like%20without%20social%20media.%20By%20way%20of%20an%20answer%2C%20I%20project%20a%20photograph%20of%20a%20bench%20overlooking%20a%20quiet%20pastoral%20landscape.%20As%20a%20technology%20enthusiast%2C%20I%E2%80%99m%20a%20believer%20in%20the%20IndieWeb%20movement%20and%20think%20it%20will%20play%20an%20important%20role%20in%20the%20future%20of%20the%20Internet.%20For%20the%20exhausted%20majority%20of%20social-media%20users%2C%20however%2C%20the%20appeal%20of%20the%20proverbial%20quiet%20bench%20might%20outweigh%20the%20lure%20of%20a%20better%20Facebook.%20In%20this%20vision%20of%20the%20future%2C%20there%20will%20be%20ma

the IndieWeb movement—or a streamlined, user-friendly version of it to come—succeed in redeeming the promise of social media? If we itemize the woes currently afflicting the major platforms, there’s a strong case to be made that the IndieWeb avoids them. When social-media servers aren’t controlled by a small number of massive public companies, the incentive to exploit users diminishes. The homegrown, community-oriented feel of the IndieWeb is superior to the vibe of anxious narcissism that’s degrading existing services. And, in a sense, decentralization also helps solve the problem of content moderation. One reason Mark Zuckerberg has called for the establishment of a third-party moderation organization is, presumably, that he’s realized how difficult it is to come up with a single set of guidelines capable of satisfying over a billion users; the IndieWeb would allow many different standards to emerge, trusting users to gravitate toward the ones that work for them. Decentralization still provides corners in which dark ideas can fester, but knowing that there’s a neo-Nazi Mastodon instance out there somewhere may be preferable to encountering neo-Nazis in your Twitter mentions. The Internet may work better when it’s spread out, as originally designed."],["p","Despite its advantages, however, I suspect that the IndieWeb will not succeed in replacing existing social-media platforms at their current scale. For one thing, the IndieWeb lacks the carefully engineered addictiveness that helped fuel the rise of services like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This addictiveness has kept people returning to their devices even when they know there are better uses for their time; remove the addiction, and you might lose the users."],["p","It may be, too, that people who are uneasy about social media aren’t looking for a better version of it but are instead ready to permanently reduce the role that smartphone screens play in their lives. Many of those who flocked to social media out of a sense of exuberance or experimentation are now losing interest.

Others are older people who tried social media later in life, when it seemed like the thing to do, but now doubt that it’s worth the effort. Increasing numbers of teen-agers are rejecting the ceaseless pressure for digital performance; in March, Edison Research released a report claiming that young people made up the largest share of the fifteen million users Facebook has lost since 2017. To be sixteen and offline has become countercultural."],["p","At the end of my ",["em",{"class":"small"},"TED"],"x talk, I note that people often ask me what life is like without social media. By way of an answer, I project a photograph of a bench overlooking a quiet pastoral landscape. As a technology enthusiast, I’m a believer in the IndieWeb movement and think it will play an important role in the future of the Internet. For the exhausted majority of social-media users, however, the appeal of the proverbial quiet bench might outweigh the lure of a better Facebook. In this vision of the future, there will be many more social-media platforms but far fewer people spending significant time on any of them. Social media has reshaped our culture, and this has convinced us that it is fundamentally appealing. Strip away its most manipulative elements, though, and we may find that it’s less rewarding than it seems."]]],"canonicalUrl":"https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/can-indie-social-media-save-us","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1f0e41c92e2c9b85dc48","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1f0e41c92e2c9b85dc48","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Cal

from a small town in North Carolina, came to Harvard, on financial aid, and began to take courses in the humanities. The next fall, trying to get a spot in a dorm near his close female friends, he joined a rooming group with an acquaintance named [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/17/can-mark-zuckerberg-fix-facebook-before-it-breaks-democracy), who was perpetually at work on minor computer schemes. One of them, the Facebook, blew up. Hughes, who was on hand in the dorm—he was the first user after Zuckerberg—had no technical skills, but he was a good writer, and was put in charge of early public relations: figuring out how to sell the site to a few other schools, and suggesting tweaks to make the interface friendlier. This role expanded, along with the site, and, in 2012, Hughes cashed out. He traded his equity—approximately two per cent of the company—for about half a billion dollars.\n\nAll that now seems a long time ago. Late last week, the *Times* published a six-thousand-word [essay by Hughes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html) suggesting that Facebook ought to be broken up. “Because Facebook so dominates social networking, it faces no market-based accountability,” Hughes argues. “This means that every time Facebook messes up, we repeat an exhausting pattern: first outrage, then disappointment and, finally, resignation.” Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, lacks true competition, Hughes writes; Mark Zuckerberg has too much unchecked control over the company’s direction and the content posted by its users. “Mark’s power is unprecedented and un-American,” Hughes says, in a strident turn.\n\nThe company retorted with a brisk [statement](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/business/facebook-response-chris-hughes.html); its communications head (a post that Hughes once held) has issued his own [opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/opinion/facebook-nick-clegg-chris-hughes.html); and Zuckerberg, who was in France this weekend, [told](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/11/mark-zuckerberg-says-breaking-up-facebook-isnt-going-to-do-anything-to-help.html) a broadcaster that the public should “want a company like us to invest billions of dollars a year, like we are, in building up really advanced tools to fight election interference”—a statement so mind-bendingly at odds with experience that it almost seemed a kind of koan. Hughes has trimmed his essay with the ribbons of uxorious good will (“Mark is a good, kind person”), as if to say: This isn’t personal. Still, in media coverage, it has been treated as a watershed—proof that Facebook has defaulted even on friendship. Things have got that bad.\n\nThe essay’s true interest lies elsewhere, though: it *is* personal, albeit in a different sense. The piece follows in the footsteps of Hughes’s book “[Fair Shot: Rethinking Inequality and How We Earn](https://www.amazon.com/Fair-Shot-Rethinking-Inequality-Earn/dp/1250196590),” which was published last year (and which I [wrote about](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/09/who-really-stands-to-win-from-universal-basic-income) in this magazine). In the eyes of some of the Fourth Estate, Hughes may be persona non grata, due to his acquisition, controversial management, and benighted sale of *The New Republic*, earlier this decade. But “Fair Shot” made clear that he is also a much greater anomaly: a super-rich person who takes his super-richness as proof that the economic game is rigged. In his book, Hughes wrote that, “in a winner-take-all world, a small group of people get outsized returns as a result of early actions they take.” His vantage on Facebook is significant not just because he was there when the orchard was planted but because he saw what it took to make the trees bear fruit. In his eyes, the input and the yield don’t match. “I didn’t feel like some kind of genius, and while Mark was smart and talented, so were many of the other people I went to college with,” he wrote.\n\nIn his book, Hughes attributed the explosive growth of startups like Facebook—and the skyrocketing value of their stock—to corporate deregulation, reduced tariffs, and the rise of venture capital and other forms of private equity across the seventies and eighties. He picks up this thread in his *Times* essay, with the suggestion that, for decades, antitrust legislation has been eclipsed by a perverted form of free-market ideology—a growing consensus that “private interests should take precedence over public ones.” As a result of this kind of thinking, he notes, the average size of public companies has tripled. The results “are a decline in entrepreneurship, stalled productivity growth, and higher prices and fewer choices for consumers.”\n\nHughes sees Facebook’s story within this frame. An important idea in his *Times* essay is that what he calls Facebook’s unchecked “dominance” is not the result of out-of-bounds decision-making; instead, it is the consequence of a world view that has changed how wealth and business interests flow. (At one point, Hughes recalls a conversation in which the C.E.O. complained about the pressure he was under: “Now that we employ so many people.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We just really can’t fail.”) Zuckerberg, he writes, has displayed “nothing more nefarious than the virtuous hustle of a talented entrepreneur.” \n\nIf Hughes shifts culpability away from Facebook in particular, it is thus in the service of more general blame. Silicon Valley regards itself as being divided between good- and bad-actor companies. Most people agree that Elizabeth Holmes and her fraudulent firm Theranos were bad actors. (It reveals something about the Valley that this view is not held universally.) Increasingly, tech people trade in the idea that Facebook is a bad actor, too. Hughes is saying the opposite. Facebook was just doing business on the given terms; it became a bad actor simply by meeting targets for success. By implication, other companies that are deemed good actors should alarm us, too. “It’s on our government,” Hughes writes, to undo Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp. He proposes the creation of a new governmental agency expressly for regulating tech.\n\nAt a moment when the identity of the putative political left is often defined in terms of narrow doctrines, it is easy to overlook the radicalism of this view—the true sharp edge in Hughes’s essay. He seeks not to disaggregate one company but to reshape the way big business exercises influence in American society. He wants the government to cap a model of corporate growth that, like a blender without a lid, has been jetting wealth up and over the rim of the middle class. Although Hughes’s book was blurbed by Cory Booker, he name-checks Elizabeth Warren twice in his *Times* essay—a tacit endorsement, and a striking one. Traditionally, equality-minded tech millionaires have favored floor-raising initiatives: these seem to improve the lot of Middle-Class Joe without impeding growth in shareholder-driven businesses. (Such a floor-raising system was, in fact, the main preoccupation of “Fair Shot.”) But breaking up Facebook, or any similarly monopolistic company, is something slightly different: it has the effect of imposing ceilings. This reflects a more sophisticated idea of reform. Since inequality exists between two points—a bottom and a top—a rising floor means little if the giants, corporate and individual, keep growing more quickly. Regulatory ceilings for tech and other powerful industries are a big part of the Warren platform. The idea is not simply to drop a few more nourishing berries in the blender but, for the first time in decades, to replace the lid.\n\nThe phrase “regulatory reform” tends to make people’s eyes go glassy. It lacks the human drama of a Brutus blow against one’s former boss and friend. And yet it’s that suggestion, not a specific charge against Facebook, that makes Hughes’s essay bold and—from the mouth of a multimillionaire—a little daring. What he proposes in his essay and his book would affect the way the tech industry runs, changing the flow of investment capital, the strategies for growth, the people to whom the spoils of efficiency go. It would lessen the power of giants and make bonanzas rarer. And it’s only somewhat overdue. Digital commerce may be filled with giants, but, happily for all the rest of us, they aren’t yet too big to fail.

Facebook, has a tortuous relationship with government regulation. After committing his company to abide by the strict privacy requirements of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations (G.D.P.R.) in April, 2018, [internal documents](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/02/facebook-global-lobbying-campaign-against-data-privacy-laws-investment) showed that Facebook had been pursuing vigorous anti-regulation lobbying campaigns throughout the world. According to the *Guardian*, this included threatening to withhold investment in countries that didn’t support “Facebook friendly” laws and using the Facebook C.O.O. Sheryl Sandberg’s corporate-feminist playbook, “[Lean In](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Women-Work-Will-Lead/dp/0385349947),” to woo “hostile” female E.U. commissioners. But, on March 30th, Zuckerberg wrote an op-ed in the Washington *Post* proposing that businesses like his needed regulation in the areas of harmful content, election integrity, privacy, and data protection. It was either another public-relations ploy—this one intended to mute criticism of the social network after the terrorist attack on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, which killed fifty worshippers, was broadcast live on Facebook. Or else it was a cry for help, as it became clear, once again, that Zuckerberg and his cadre of fifteen thousand “content moderators” have little control over the platform. “At our scale,” [he wrote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-zuckerberg-the-internet-needs-new-rules-lets-start-in-these-four-areas/2019/03/29/9e6f0504-521a-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html?utm_term=.3e4f064b5bc3), “we’ll always make mistakes.”\n\nBroadcasting the murder of fifty people was obviously something more than a mistake. Facebook was able to remove millions of rebroadcasts of the Christchurch massacre, but neither its human moderators nor its A.I. filters could prevent copies from spreading virally. It’s unlikely that government regulation could have, either. When Zuckerberg writes that “I believe we need a more active role for governments and regulators,” he may be hoping that, when the platform is used maliciously, this will shift the focus from the failure of Facebook to the failure of regulation, or at least dilute the blame.\n\nZuckerberg and his team are masters of the P.R. sleight of hand. They have been paying the British newspaper the *Telegraph* [for upbeat sponsored content](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-daily-telegraph-positive-sponsored-news-stories-2019-4) about the company, including a feature titled “What action is Facebook taking to tackle terrorist content?,” which ran two days before the Christchurch attack. This week, just days after Zuckerberg called for tighter online privacy in his essay, [it was reported](https://www.thedailybeast.com/beyond-sketchy-facebook-demanding-some-new-users-email-passwords) that Facebook has been requiring some new users to hand over their personal e-mail passwords in order to use the service. The company’s 24/7 [election-interference “war room,”](https://mashable.com/article/facebook-election-war-room-empty-for-now/#KboQu12brsqt) which opened to great fanfare before the November midterms, was quietly dismantled once members of the press had traipsed through and filed their stories. \n\nSo perhaps a healthy dose of skepticism is in order when Zuckerberg writes that Facebook will be creating an independent body because “we shouldn’t make so many important decisions about speech on our own.” It’s also unclear how independent an independent body created by the company it is meant to oversee can be, or if the company will empanel known partisans in an attempt to look non-partisan, as it did a few months ago, when Facebook added the unabashedly conservative (and now defunct) *Weekly Standard* to its [fact-checking roster](https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-weekly-standard-played-facebook-and-screwed-think-progress). This has also become a fractious issue at Google, which recently named the president of the Koch-funded Heritage Foundation to its artificial-intelligence ethics advisory board, prompting an outcry from scores of [Google employees](https://medium.com/@against.transphobia/googlers-against-transphobia-and-hate-b1b0a5dbf76). (The company dismantled the board a few days later.) And, if Facebook’s independent advisory board is tasked with insuring that users uphold the company’s fuzzy, internally derived “community standards”—which, by the way, allow the “banned” conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to continue creating new Facebook pages as long as they don’t violate those standards—then it is compromised out of the gate. \n\nBusinesses typically eschew regulation. In this country, one legacy of the Reagan years is that a significant cohort of politicians and voters do as well. Regulation is often held up as an inhibitor of innovation, while the remarkable inventiveness and growth of American technology companies is attributed to the country’s lax regulatory climate. Zuckerberg suggests as much when he says that “the rules governing the Internet allowed a generation of entrepreneurs to build services that changed the world and created a lot of value in people’s lives.” The Federal Trade Commission has been especially complaisant—it is only now getting around to fining Facebook for failing to abide by its 2011 consent decree intended to protect users’ privacy. Congress, meanwhile, has made a show of inviting Zuckerberg and other tech leaders, including Sundar Pichai, the C.E.O. of Google, to its chambers, ostensibly to call them to account, but then has done nothing to check the power of their companies. \n\nThere are numerous reasons for this. As we saw from their fawning, elementary and sometimes inane questions during those hearings, few members of Congress understand the technology that they are tasked with regulating. The Office of Technology Assessment, which could have guided them, was shut down by the 104th Congress, in 1995, when the Republicans had control of both the House and Senate. More crucially, legislators are under the sway of an army of lobbyists: Google alone spent more than twenty-one million dollars on lobbying last year; together, Google, Facebook, and Amazon spent an unprecedented [forty-eight million dollars](https://www.recode.net/2019/1/23/18194328/google-amazon-facebook-lobby-record), which was an increase of seventeen per cent from the previous year, much of it to stave off regulation. (A recent tweet by the digital-rights activist and developer Aral Balkan put this in perspective, claiming that Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, had told him, at a private book event in SoHo, “I wake up every morning and I fight regulation, it’s what I do, it’s my job.”) \n\nSo far, the only significant reckoning for the tech industry has come from the European Union, which pursued Apple for tax avoidance in Ireland, resulting in a back-tax bill of [more than fourteen billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/technology/apple-tax-eu-ireland.html) dollars; challenged Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp, by issuing a [hundred-and-twenty-two-million-dollar](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/technology/facebook-european-union-fine-whatsapp.html) fine; and is currently investigating Amazon for antitrust violations. Ten years ago, the E.U.’s Commissioner for Competition, whose office has brought these actions, began investigating Google for unfair advertising practices. During most of those years, Google shut out other companies that wanted to sell ads next to the Google search bar. In 2016, the company stopped the practice after receiving what was essentially a cease-and-desist order from the E.U. But the damage was done. “For a ten-year period, Google did the wrong thing,” Margrethe Vestager, the E.U.’s commissioner for competition, told me. “It denied other companies the possibility of doing business and it denied us, as consumers, the probability that we would have other ads, better ads. And there was a high risk that, because of what it was doing, ads were more expensive. And, when ads are more expensive, the cost will rebound to us as consumers.” Last month, Vestager fined Google $1\\.7 billion in the case. All told, Google has been censured three times since 2014, when Vestager became commissioner, and has been slapped with more than nine billion dollars in fines. \n\nVestager’s reputation in the United States as the toughest cop on the tech beat—a New York *Times* headline, “Who Strikes Fear Into Silicon Valley? Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s Antitrust Enforcer,” is typical—is evidence that, for the most part, she walks the beat alone. “Your tax lady, she really hates the U.S.,” President Trump [told](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tax/2018/06/11/your-tax-lady-248338) Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, last year. (In fact, much of Vestager’s antitrust work concerns big European companies, such as the [Swedish furniture giant](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/business/ikea-tax-eu.html) *Ikea*{:.small}.) “We are trying to get a hold on this industrial revolution that’s happening right now,” Vestager told me. “It’s been the nature of every industrial revolution, where you say, ‘Wow! That’s amazing,’ and eventually you realize there are things that you have to deal with—working conditions, child labor, harmful substances in the workplace, all of that. Here it’s very important that we get up to speed quite quickly, because these are fast moving technologies, fast moving markets, and if we want our democracies to set the direction, instead of businesses doing so, it’s a matter of urgency.”\n\nThe office of the E.U. Commissioner for Competition is not a regulatory body. It doesn’t make rules or pass laws. Instead, it is reactive, using laws on the books—especially in the antitrust area—in the interest of fairness. And, yet, it’s possible to see something of Europe’s approach in Senator Elizabeth Warren’s recent [proposal to break up Big Tech](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c). In a white paper published on Medium, last month, Warren lays out an existential rationale for her argument, writing that “we must ensure that today’s tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies, and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy.” She then diagnoses the problem: tech companies have used mergers and proprietary marketplaces to limit competition. That is how the five Big Tech companies—Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft—have grown their businesses. They have hoovered up four hundred thirty-six companies during the past ten years, almost all without antitrust reviews. Facebook even deployed [an app](https://theintercept.com/2019/04/01/elizabeth-warren-tech-regulation-2020/) that looked for rivals that it could either buy or kill.\n\nOther senators, most notably Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, who issued his [own white paper](https://www.axios.com/mark-warner-google-facebook-regulation-policy-paper-023d4a52-2b25-4e44-a87c-945e73c637fa.html) last July, have attempted to take “the frightful five” to task for business practices that have compromised both privacy and democracy. But Warren offers a more resolute strategy: to designate as a “platform utility” any company with global revenue above twenty-five billion dollars that operates an online marketplace, exchange, or method of connecting third-parties, and prohibit them from owning both the platform and its users. This would include Google’s search engine, its ad business, and Amazon’s Marketplace. Companies that fail to follow these requirements would be fined and made to pay back ill-gotten gains. Twenty-five billion is an arbitrary number, but it’s a big one, which is the point. It would encompass the behemoths with gargantuan appetites, which are destined to swallow both competition and consumers. Warren also proposes reviving antitrust laws to uncouple anti-competitive mergers, like Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp, and Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods and Zappos. These are strong measures that have not won the senator any friends in the tech community or, as The Intercept has pointed out, among journalists and scholars who receive funding from it. It is also probably not the kind of regulation Zuckerberg has in mind.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c22d4972cd5b83297","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Amazon","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"amazon"},{"id":"5c2e1c84ee7fe02cbd163345","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Google","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"google"},{"id":"5c2e1ca436cecf4019214219","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Apple","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"apple"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark Zuckerberg","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mark-zuckerberg"},{"id":"5c2e1c774a08312cd3aa6c36","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elizabeth Warren","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elizabeth-warren"},{"id":"5c2e1fd8d534212cdfecc583","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Margrethe Vestager","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"margrethe-vestager"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f161ebe912338a3717da","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Technology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-technology"}]},"channel":"Tech","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a5ac2e2e17730741c5fa","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sue Halpern, a contributing writer covering politics and technology, has been writing for *The New Yorker* since 2005.

He does not enjoy interviews, especially after two years of ceaseless controversy. Having got his start as a programmer with a nocturnal bent, he is also not a morning person. Walking toward the kitchen, which has a long farmhouse table and cabinets painted forest green, he said, “I haven’t eaten breakfast yet. Have you?”\n\nSince 2011, Zuckerberg has lived in a century-old white clapboard Craftsman in the Crescent Park neighborhood, an enclave of giant oaks and historic homes not far from Stanford University. The house, which cost seven million dollars, affords him a sense of sanctuary. It’s set back from the road, shielded by hedges, a wall, and mature trees. Guests enter through an arched wooden gate and follow a long gravel path to a front lawn with a saltwater pool in the center. The year after Zuckerberg bought the house, he and his longtime girlfriend, Priscilla Chan, held their wedding in the back yard, which encompasses gardens, a pond, and a shaded pavilion. Since then, they have had two children, and acquired a seven-hundred-acre estate in Hawaii, a ski retreat in Montana, and a four-story town house on Liberty Hill, in San Francisco. But the family’s full-time residence is here, a ten-minute drive from Facebook’s headquarters.\n\nOccasionally, Zuckerberg records a Facebook video from the back yard or the dinner table, as is expected of a man who built his fortune exhorting employees to keep “pushing the world in the direction of making it a more open and transparent place.” But his appetite for personal openness is limited. Although Zuckerberg is the most famous entrepreneur of his generation, he remains elusive to everyone but a small circle of family and friends, and his efforts to protect his privacy inevitably attract attention. The local press has chronicled his feud with a developer who announced plans to build a mansion that would look into Zuckerberg’s master bedroom. After a legal fight, the developer gave up, and Zuckerberg spent forty-four million dollars to buy the houses surrounding his. Over the years, he has come to believe that he will always be the subject of criticism. “We’re not—pick your noncontroversial business—selling dog food, although I think that people who do that probably say there is controversy in that, too, but this is an inherently cultural thing,” he told me, of his business. “It’s at the intersection of technology and psychology, and it’s very personal.”\n\nHe carried a plate of banana bread and a carafe of water into the living room, and settled onto a navy-blue velvet sofa. Since co-founding Facebook, in 2004, his uniform has evolved from hoodies and flip-flops to his current outfit, a gray sweater, indigo jeans, and black Nikes. At thirty-four, Zuckerberg, who has very fair skin, a tall forehead, and large eyes, is leaner than when he first became a public figure, more than a decade ago. On the porch, next to the front door, he keeps a Peloton stationary bike, a favorite accessory in the tech world, which live-streams a personal trainer to your home. Zuckerberg uses the machine, but he does not love cycling. A few years ago, on his first attempt to use a road bike with racing pedals, he forgot to unclip, tipped over, and broke his arm. Except for cycling on his porch, he said, “I haven’t clipped in since.”\n\nHe and his wife prefer board games to television, and, within reach of the couch, I noticed a game called Ricochet Robots. “It gets extremely competitive,” Zuckerberg said. “We play with these friends, and one of them is a genius at this. Playing with him is just infuriating.” Dave Morin, a former Facebook employee who is the founder and C.E.O. of Sunrise Bio, a startup seeking cures for depression, used to play Risk with Zuckerberg at the office. “He’s not playing you in a game of Risk. He’s playing you in a game of games,” Morin told me. “The first game, he might amass all his armies on one property, and the next game he might spread them all over the place. He’s trying to figure out the psychological way to beat you in all the games.”\n\nAcross the tech industry, the depth of Zuckerberg’s desire to win is often remarked upon. Dick Costolo, the former C.E.O. of [Twitter](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Twitter), told me, “He’s a ruthless execution machine, and if he has decided to come after you, you’re going to take a beating.” Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, said, “There are a number of people in the Valley who have a perception of Mark that he’s really aggressive and competitive. I think some people are a little hesitant about him from that perspective.” Hoffman has been an investor in Facebook since its early days, but for a long time he sensed that Zuckerberg kept his distance because they were both building social networks. “For many years, it was, like, ‘Your LinkedIn thing is going to be crushed, so even though we’re friendly, I don’t want to get too close to you personally, because I’m going to crush you.’ Now, of course, that’s behind us and we’re good friends.”\n\nWhen I asked Zuckerberg about this reputation, he framed the dynamic differently. The survival of any social-media business rests on “network effects,” in which the value of the network grows only by finding new users. As a result, he said, “there’s a natural zero-sumness. If we’re going to achieve what we want to, it’s not just about building the best features. It’s about building the best community.” He added, “I care about succeeding. And, yes, sometimes you have to beat someone to something, in order to get to the next thing. But that’s not primarily the way that I think I roll.”\n\nFor many years, Zuckerberg ended Facebook meetings with the half-joking exhortation “Domination!” Although he eventually stopped doing this (in European legal systems, “dominance” refers to corporate monopoly), his discomfort with losing is undimmed. A few years ago, he played Scrabble on a corporate jet with a friend’s daughter, who was in high school at the time. She won. Before they played a second game, he wrote a simple computer program that would look up his letters in the dictionary so that he could choose from all possible words. Zuckerberg’s program had a narrow lead when the flight landed. The girl told me, “During the game in which I was playing the program, everyone around us was taking sides: Team Human and Team Machine.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIf Facebook were a country, it would have the largest population on earth. More than 2.2 billion people, about a third of humanity, log in at least once a month. That user base has no precedent in the history of American enterprise. Fourteen years after it was founded, in Zuckerberg’s dorm room, Facebook has as many adherents as Christianity.\n\nA couple of years ago, the company was still revelling in its power. By collecting vast quantities of information about its users, it allows advertisers to target people with precision—a business model that earns Facebook more ad revenue in a year than all American newspapers combined. Zuckerberg was spending much of his time conferring with heads of state and unveiling plans of fantastical ambition, such as building giant drones that would beam free Internet (including Facebook) into developing countries. He enjoyed extraordinary control over his company; in addition to his positions as chairman and C.E.O., he controlled about sixty per cent of shareholder votes, thanks to a special class of stock with ten times the power of ordinary shares. His personal fortune had grown to more than sixty billion dollars. Facebook was one of four companies (along with Google, Amazon, and Apple) that dominated the Internet; the combined value of their stock is larger than the G.D.P. of France.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cfdbd07a5060baeb7b]||||||\n+++\n\nFor years, Facebook had heard concerns about its use of private data and its ability to shape people’s behavior. The company’s troubles came to a head during the Presidential election of 2016, when propagandists used the site to spread misinformation that helped turn society against itself. Some of the culprits were profiteers who gamed Facebook’s automated systems with toxic political clickbait known as “fake news.” In a prime example, at least a hundred Web sites were traced to Veles, Macedonia, a small city where entrepreneurs, some still in high school, discovered that posting fabrications to pro-[Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) Facebook groups unleashed geysers of traffic. Fake-news sources also paid Facebook to “microtarget” ads at users who had proved susceptible in the past.\n\nThe other culprits, according to U.S. intelligence, were Russian agents who wanted to sow political chaos and help Trump win. In February, [Robert Mueller](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mueller), the special counsel investigating Russia’s role in the election, charged thirteen Russians with an “interference operation” that made use of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The Internet Research Agency, a firm in St. Petersburg working for the Kremlin, drew hundreds of thousands of users to Facebook groups optimized to stoke outrage, including Secured Borders, Blacktivist, and Defend the 2nd. They used Facebook to organize offline rallies, and bought Facebook ads intended to hurt Hillary Clinton’s standing among Democratic voters. (One read “Hillary Clinton Doesn’t Deserve the Black Vote.”) With fewer than a hundred operatives, the I.R.A. achieved an astonishing impact: Facebook estimates that the content reached as many as a hundred and fifty million users.\n\nAt the same time, former Facebook executives, echoing a growing body of research, began to voice misgivings about the company’s role in exacerbating isolation, outrage, and addictive behaviors. One of the largest studies, published last year in the _American Journal of Epidemiology_, followed the Facebook use of more than five thousand people over three years and found that higher use correlated with self-reported declines in physical health, mental health, and life satisfaction. At an event in November, 2017, Sean Parker, Facebook’s first president, called himself a “conscientious objector” to social media, saying, “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.” A few days later, Chamath Palihapitiya, the former vice-president of user growth, told an audience at Stanford, “The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works—no civil discourse, no coöperation, misinformation, mistruth.” Palihapitiya, a prominent [Silicon Valley](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Silicon-Valley) figure who worked at Facebook from 2007 to 2011, said, “I feel tremendous guilt. I think we all knew in the back of our minds.” Of his children, he added, “They’re not allowed to use this shit.” (Facebook replied to the remarks in a statement, noting that Palihapitiya had left six years earlier, and adding, “Facebook was a very different company back then.”)\n\nIn March, Facebook was confronted with an even larger scandal: the _Times_ and the British newspaper the _Observer_ reported that a researcher had gained access to the personal information of Facebook users and sold it to [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Cambridge-Analytica), a consultancy hired by Trump and other Republicans which advertised using “psychographic” techniques to manipulate voter behavior. In all, the personal data of eighty-seven million people had been harvested. Moreover, Facebook had known of the problem since December of 2015 but had said nothing to users or regulators. The company acknowledged the breach only after the press discovered it.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica revelations touched off the most serious crisis in Facebook’s history, and, with it, a public reckoning with the power of Big Tech. Facebook is now under investigation by the F.B.I., the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as by authorities abroad, from London to Brussels to Sydney. Facebook’s peers and rivals have expressed conspicuously little sympathy. [Elon Musk](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Elon-Musk) deleted his Facebook pages and those of his companies, Tesla and SpaceX. [Tim Cook](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Tim-Cook), the C.E.O. of Apple, told an interviewer, “We could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer,” but “we’ve elected not to do that.” At Facebook’s annual shareholder meeting, in May, executives struggled to keep order. An investor who interrupted the agenda to argue against Zuckerberg’s renomination as chairman was removed. Outside, an airplane flew a banner that read “*YOU BROKE DEMOCRACY.*{: .small}” It was paid for by Freedom from Facebook, a coalition of progressive groups that have asked the F.T.C. to break up the company into smaller units.\n\nOn July 25th, Facebook’s stock price dropped nineteen per cent, cutting its market value by a hundred and nineteen billion dollars, the largest one-day drop in Wall Street history. Nick Bilton, a technology writer at _Vanity Fair_, tweeted that Zuckerberg was losing $2.7 million per second, “double what the average American makes in an entire lifetime.” Facebook’s user base had flatlined in the U.S. and Canada, and dropped slightly in Europe, and executives warned that revenue growth would decline further, in part because the scandals had led users to opt out of allowing Facebook to collect some data. Facebook depends on trust, and the events of the past two years had made people wonder whether the company deserved it.\n\nZuckerberg’s friends describe his travails as a by-product of his success. He is often compared to another Harvard dropout, [Bill Gates](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Bill-Gates), who has been his mentor in business and philanthropy. Gates told me, “Somebody who is smart, and rich, and ends up not acknowledging problems as quickly as they should will be attacked as arrogant. That comes with the territory.” He added, “I wouldn’t say that Mark’s an arrogant individual.” But, to critics, Facebook is guilty of a willful blindness driven by greed, naïveté, and contempt for oversight.\n\nIn a series of conversations over the summer, I talked to Zuckerberg about Facebook’s problems, and about his underlying views on technology and society. We spoke at his home, at his office, and by phone. I also interviewed four dozen people inside and outside the company about its culture, his performance, and his decision-making. I found Zuckerberg straining, not always coherently, to grasp problems for which he was plainly unprepared. These are not technical puzzles to be cracked in the middle of the night but some of the subtlest aspects of human affairs, including the meaning of truth, the limits of free speech, and the origins of violence.\n\nZuckerberg is now at the center of a full-fledged debate about the moral character of Silicon Valley and the conscience of its leaders. Leslie Berlin, a historian of technology at Stanford, told me, “For a long time, Silicon Valley enjoyed an unencumbered embrace in America. And now everyone says, Is this a trick? And the question Mark Zuckerberg is dealing with is: Should my company be the arbiter of truth and decency for two billion people? Nobody in the history of technology has dealt with that.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nFacebook’s headquarters, at 1 Hacker Way, in Menlo Park, overlooking the salt marshes south of San Francisco, has the feel of a small, prosperous dictatorship, akin to Kuwait or Brunei. The campus is a self-contained universe, with the full range of free Silicon Valley perks: dry cleaning, haircuts, music lessons, and food by the acre, including barbecue, biryani, and salad bars. (New arrivals are said to put on the “Facebook fifteen.”) Along with stock options and generous benefits, such trappings have roots in the nineteen-seventies, when, Leslie Berlin said, founders aspired to create pleasant workplaces and stave off the rise of labor unions. The campus, which was designed with the help of consultants from Disney, is arranged as an ersatz town that encircles a central plaza, with shops and restaurants and offices along a main street. From the air, the word “*Hack*{: .small}” is visible in gigantic letters on the plaza pavement.\n\nOn Zuckerberg’s campus, he is king. Executives offer fulsome praise. David Marcus, who runs Facebook’s blockchain project, told me recently, “When I see him portrayed in certain ways, it really hurts me personally, because it’s not the guy he is.” Even when colleagues speak more candidly, on the whole they like him. “He’s not an asshole,” a former senior executive told me. “That’s why people work there so long.”\n\nBefore I visited Zuckerberg for the first time, in June, members of his staff offered the kind of advice usually reserved for approaching a skittish bird: proceed gingerly, build a connection, avoid surprises. The advice, I discovered, wasn’t necessary. In person, he is warmer and more direct than his public pronouncements, which resemble a politician’s bland pablum, would suggest. The contrast between the public and the private Zuckerberg reminded me of Hillary Clinton. In both cases, friends complain that the popular image is divorced from the casual, funny, generous person they know. Yet neither Zuckerberg nor Clinton has found a way to publicly express a more genuine persona. In Zuckerberg’s case, moments of self-reflection are so rare that, last spring, following a CNN interview in which he said that he wanted to build a company that “my girls are going to grow up and be proud of me for,” the network framed the clip as a news event, with the title “Zuckerberg in rare emotional moment.”\n\nI asked Zuckerberg about his aversion to opening up.“I’m not the most polished person, and I will say something wrong, and you see the cost of that,” he said. “I don’t want to inflict that pain, or do something that’s going to not reflect well on the people around me.” In the most recent flap, a few weeks earlier, he had told Kara Swisher, the host of the “[Recode Decode](https://www.recode.net/2018/7/18/17575158/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-full-transcript-kara-swisher)” podcast, that he permits Holocaust deniers on Facebook because he isn’t sure if they are “intentionally getting it wrong.” After a furor erupted, he issued a statement saying that he finds Holocaust denial “deeply offensive.” Zuckerberg told me, “In an alternate world where there weren’t the compounding experiences that I had, I probably would have gotten more comfortable being more personal, and out there, and I wouldn’t have felt pushback every time I did something. And maybe my persona, or at least how I felt comfortable acting publicly, would shift.”\n\nThe downside of Zuckerberg’s exalted status within his company is that it is difficult for him to get genuine, unexpurgated feedback. He has tried, at times, to puncture his own bubble. In 2013, as a New Year’s resolution, he pledged to meet someone new, outside Facebook, every day. In 2017, he travelled to more than thirty states on a “listening tour” that he hoped would better acquaint him with the outside world. David Plouffe, President Obama’s former campaign manager, who is now the head of policy and advocacy at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the family’s philanthropic investment company, attended some events on the tour. He told me, “When a politician goes to one of those, it’s an hour, and they’re talking for fifty of those minutes. He would talk for, like, five, and just ask questions.”\n\nBut the exercise came off as stilted and tone-deaf. Zuckerberg travelled with a professional photographer, who documented him feeding a calf in Wisconsin, ordering barbecue, and working on an assembly line at a Ford plant in Michigan. Online, people joked that the photos made him look like an extraterrestrial exploring the human race for the first time. A former Facebook executive who was involved in the tour told a friend, “No one wanted to tell Mark, and no one did tell Mark, that this really looks just dumb.”\n\nZuckerberg has spent nearly half his life inside a company of his own making, handpicking his lieutenants, and sculpting his environment to suit him. Even Facebook’s signature royal blue reflects his tastes. He is red-green color-blind, and he chose blue because he sees it most vividly. [Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Sheryl-Sandberg), the chief operating officer, told me, “Sometimes Mark will say, in front of the company, ‘Well, I’ve never worked anywhere else, but Sheryl tells me .&#160;.&#160;.’&#160;” She went on, “He acknowledges he doesn’t always have the most experience. He’s only had the experience he’s had, and being Mark Zuckerberg is pretty extraordinary.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nLong before it seemed inevitable or even plausible, Mark Elliot Zuckerberg had an outsized sense of his own potential. It was “a teleological frame of feeling almost chosen,” a longtime friend told me. “I think Mark has always seen himself as a man of history, someone who is destined to be great, and I mean that in the broadest sense of the term.” Zuckerberg has observed that more than a few giants of history grew up in bourgeois comfort near big cities and then channelled those advantages into transformative power.\n\nIn Zuckerberg’s case, the setting was Dobbs Ferry, New York, a Westchester County suburb twenty-five miles north of New York City. His mother, Karen Kempner, grew up in Queens; on a blind date, she met a mailman’s son, Edward Zuckerberg, of Flatbush, who was studying to be a dentist. They married and had four children. Mark, the only boy, was the second-oldest. His mother, who had become a psychiatrist, eventually gave up her career to take care of the kids and manage the dental office, which was connected to the family home. Of his father, Zuckerberg told me, “He was a dentist, but he was also a huge techie. So he always had not just a system for drilling teeth but, like, the laser system for drilling teeth that was controlled by the computer.” Ed Zuckerberg marketed himself as the Painless Dr. Z, and later drummed up dentistry business with a direct-mail solicitation that declared, “I am literally the Father of Facebook!” (Since 2013, Zuckerberg’s parents have lived in California, where Ed practices part time and lectures on using social media to attract patients.)\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cf2c0c1035aeefc65e]||||||\n+++\n\nIn the nineteen-eighties and nineties, Ed bought early personal computers—the Atari 800, the I.B.M. XT—and Mark learned to code. At twelve, he set up his first network, ZuckNet, on which messages and files could be shared between the house and his father’s dental office. Rabbi David Holtz, of Temple Beth Abraham, in Tarrytown, told me that he watched Zuckerberg with other kids and sensed that he was “beyond a lot of his peers. He was thinking about things that other people were not.” When I asked Zuckerberg where his drive came from, he traced it to his grandparents, who had immigrated from Europe in the early twentieth century. “They came over, went through the Great Depression, had very hard lives,” he said. “Their dream for their kids was that they would each become doctors, which they did, and my mom just always believed that we should have a bigger impact.” His eldest sister, Randi, an early Facebook spokesperson, has gone on to write books and host a radio show; Donna received her Ph.D. in classics from Princeton and edits an online classics journal; Arielle has worked at Google and as a venture capitalist.\n\nWhen Zuckerberg was a junior in high school, he transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy, where he spent most of his time coding, fencing, and studying Latin. Ancient Rome became a lifelong fascination, first because of the language (“It’s very much like coding or math, and so I appreciated that”) and then because of the history. Zuckerberg told me, “You have all these good and bad and complex figures. I think Augustus is one of the most fascinating. Basically, through a really harsh approach, he established two hundred years of world peace.” For non-classics majors: Augustus Caesar, born in 63 B.C., staked his claim to power at the age of eighteen and turned Rome from a republic into an empire by conquering Egypt, northern Spain, and large parts of central Europe. He also eliminated political opponents, banished his daughter for promiscuity, and was suspected of arranging the execution of his grandson.\n\n“What are the trade-offs in that?” Zuckerberg said, growing animated. “On the one hand, world peace is a long-term goal that people talk about today. Two hundred years feels unattainable.” On the other hand, he said, “that didn’t come for free, and he had to do certain things.” In 2012, Zuckerberg and Chan spent their honeymoon in Rome. He later said, “My wife was making fun of me, saying she thought there were three people on the honeymoon: me, her, and Augustus. All the photos were different sculptures of Augustus.” The couple named their second daughter August.\n\nIn 2002, Zuckerberg went to [Harvard](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/harvard), where he embraced the hacker mystique, which celebrates brilliance in pursuit of disruption. “The ‘fuck you’ to those in power was very strong,” the longtime friend said. In 2004, as a sophomore, he embarked on the project whose origin story is now well known: the founding of Thefacebook.com with four fellow-students (“the” was dropped the following year); the legal battles over ownership, including a suit filed by twin brothers, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, accusing Zuckerberg of stealing their idea; the disclosure of embarrassing messages in which Zuckerberg mocked users for giving him so much data (“they ‘trust me.’ dumb fucks,” he wrote); his regrets about those remarks, and his efforts, in the years afterward, to convince the world that he has left that mind-set behind.\n\nDuring Zuckerberg’s sophomore year, in line for the bathroom at a party, he met Priscilla Chan, who was a freshman. Her parents, who traced their roots to China, had grown up in Vietnam and arrived in the U.S. as refugees after the war, settling in Quincy, Massachusetts, where they washed dishes in a Chinese restaurant. Priscilla was the eldest of three daughters, and the first member of her family to go to college. “I suddenly go to Harvard, where there’s this world where people had real and meaningful intellectual pursuits,” she said. “Then I met Mark, who so exemplified that.” She was struck by how little Zuckerberg’s background had in common with her own. “Fifty per cent of people go to college from the high school I went to. You could learn how to be a carpenter or a mechanic,” she said. “I was just, like, ‘This person speaks a whole new language and lives in a framework that I’ve never seen before.’&#160;” She added, “Maybe there was some judgment on my part: ‘You don’t understand me because you went to Phillips Exeter,’&#160;” but, she said, “I had to realize early on that I was not going to change who Mark was.” After Harvard, Chan taught in a primary school and eventually became a pediatrician. In 2017, she stopped seeing patients to be the day-to-day head of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. When I asked Chan about how Zuckerberg had responded at home to the criticism of the past two years, she talked to me about _Sitzfleisch_, the German term for sitting and working for long periods of time. “He’d actually sit so long that he froze up his muscles and injured his hip,” she said.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAfter his sophomore year, Zuckerberg moved to Palo Alto and never left. Even by the standards of Silicon Valley, Facebook’s first office had a youthful feel. Zuckerberg carried two sets of business cards. One said “I’m CEO .&#160;.&#160;. bitch!” Visitors encountered a graffiti mural of a scantily clad woman riding a Rottweiler. In Adam Fisher’s “[Valley of Genius](https://www.amazon.com/Valley-Genius-Uncensored-History-Founders/dp/1455559024/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1536591936&sr=8-1&keywords=valley+of+genius+the+uncensored+history+of+silicon+valley),” an oral history of Silicon Valley, an early employee named Ezra Callahan muses, “&#160;‘How much was the direction of the internet influenced by the perspective of nineteen-, twenty-, twenty-one-year-old well-off white boys?’ That’s a real question that sociologists will be studying forever.”\n\nFacebook was fortunate to launch when it did: Silicon Valley was recovering from the dot-com bust and was entering a period of near-messianic ambitions. The Internet was no longer so new that users were scarce, but still new enough that it was largely unregulated; first movers could amass vast followings and consolidate power, and the coming rise of inexpensive smartphones would bring millions of new people online. Most important, Facebook capitalized on a resource that most people hardly knew existed: the willingness of users to subsidize the company by handing over colossal amounts of personal information, for free.\n\nIn Facebook, Zuckerberg had found the instrument to achieve his conception of greatness. His onetime speechwriter Katherine Losse, in her memoir, “[The Boy Kings](https://www.amazon.com/Boy-Kings-Journey-Social-Network/dp/1451668260/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1536591916&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Boy+Kings),” explained that the “engineering ideology of Facebook” was clear: “Scaling and growth are everything, individuals and their experiences are secondary to what is necessary to maximize the system.” Over time, Facebook devoted ever-greater focus to what is known in Silicon Valley as “growth hacking,” the constant pursuit of scale. Whenever the company talked about “connecting people,” that was, in effect, code for user growth.\n\nThen, in 2007, growth plateaued at around fifty million users and wouldn’t budge. Other social networks had maxed out at around that level, and Facebook employees wondered if they had hit a hidden limit. Zuckerberg created a special Growth Team, which had broad latitude to find ways of boosting the numbers. Among other fixes, they discovered that, by offering the site in more languages, they could open huge markets. Alex Schultz, a founding member of the Growth Team, said that he and his colleagues were fanatical in their pursuit of expansion. “You will fight for that inch, you will die for that inch,” he told me. Facebook left no opportunity untapped. In 2011, the company asked the Federal Election Commission for an exemption to rules requiring the source of funding for political ads to be disclosed. In filings, a Facebook lawyer argued that the agency “should not stand in the way of innovation.”\n\nSandy Parakilas, who joined Facebook in 2011, as an operations manager, paraphrased the message of his orientation session as “We believe in the religion of growth.” He said, “The Growth Team was the coolest. Other teams would even try to call subgroups within their teams the ‘Growth X’ or the ‘Growth Y’ to try to get people excited.”\n\nTo gain greater reach, Facebook had made the fateful decision to become a “platform” for outside developers, much as Windows had been in the realm of desktop computers, a generation before. The company had opened its trove of data to programmers who wanted to build Facebook games, personality tests, and other apps. After a few months at Facebook, Parakilas was put in charge of a team responsible for making sure that outsiders were not misusing the data, and he was unnerved by what he found. Some games were siphoning off users’ messages and photographs. In one case, he said, a developer was harvesting user information, including that of children, to create unauthorized profiles on its own Web site. Facebook had given away data before it had a system to check for abuse. Parakilas suggested that there be an audit to uncover the scale of the problem. But, according to Parakilas, an executive rejected the idea, telling him, “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?”\n\nParakilas told me, “It was very difficult to get the kind of resources that you needed to do a good job of insuring real compliance. Meanwhile, you looked at the Growth Team and they had engineers coming out of their ears. All the smartest minds are focussed on doing whatever they can possibly do to get those growth numbers up.”\n\nNew hires learned that a crucial measure of the company’s performance was how many people had logged in to Facebook on six of the previous seven days, a measurement known as L6/7\\. “You could say it’s how many people love this service so much they use it six out of seven days,” Parakilas, who left the company in 2012, said. “But, if your job is to get that number up, at some point you run out of good, purely positive ways. You start thinking about ‘Well, what are the dark patterns that I can use to get people to log back in?’&#160;”\n\nFacebook engineers became a new breed of behaviorists, tweaking levers of vanity and passion and susceptibility. The real-world effects were striking. In 2012, when Chan was in medical school, she and Zuckerberg discussed a critical shortage of organs for transplant, inspiring Zuckerberg to add a small, powerful nudge on Facebook: if people indicated that they were organ donors, it triggered a notification to friends, and, in turn, a cascade of social pressure. Researchers later found that, on the first day the feature appeared, it increased official organ-donor enrollment more than twentyfold nationwide.\n\nSean Parker later described the company’s expertise as “exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.” The goal: “How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?” Facebook engineers discovered that people find it nearly impossible not to log in after receiving an e-mail saying that someone has uploaded a picture of them. Facebook also discovered its power to affect people’s political behavior. Researchers found that, during the 2010 midterm elections, Facebook was able to prod users to vote simply by feeding them pictures of friends who had already voted, and by giving them the option to click on an “I Voted” button. The technique boosted turnout by three hundred and forty thousand people—more than four times the number of votes separating Trump and Clinton in key states in the 2016 race. It became a running joke among employees that Facebook could tilt an election just by choosing where to deploy its “I Voted” button.\n\nThese powers of social engineering could be put to dubious purposes. In 2012, Facebook data scientists used nearly seven hundred thousand people as guinea pigs, feeding them happy or sad posts to test whether emotion is contagious on social media. (They concluded that it is.) When the findings were published, in the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_, they caused an uproar among users, many of whom were horrified that their emotions may have been surreptitiously manipulated. In an apology, one of the scientists wrote, “In hindsight, the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this anxiety.”\n\nFacebook was, in the words of Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google, becoming a pioneer in “persuasive technology.” He explained, “A hammer, in your hand, is non-persuasive—it doesn’t have its own ways of manipulating the person that holds it. But Facebook and Snapchat, in their design features, are persuading a teen-ager to wake up and see photo after photo after photo of their friends having fun without them, even if it makes them feel worse.” In 2015, Harris delivered a talk at Facebook about his concern that social media was contributing to alienation. “I said, ‘You guys are in the best position in the world to deal with loneliness and see it as a thing that you are amplifying and a thing that you can help make go the other way,’&#160;” he told me. “They didn’t do anything about it.” He added, “My points were in their blind spot.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs Facebook grew, Zuckerberg and his executives adopted a core belief: even if people criticized your decisions, they would eventually come around. In one of the first demonstrations of that idea, in 2006, Facebook introduced the News Feed, a feature that suddenly alerted friends whenever a user changed profile pictures, joined groups, or altered a relationship status. (Until then, users had to visit a friend’s page to see updates.) Users revolted. There was a street protest at the headquarters, and hundreds of thousands of people joined a Facebook group opposing the change. Zuckerberg posted a tepid apology (“Calm down. Breathe. We hear you.”), and people got used to the feed.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cf477b8357353ab502]||||||\n+++\n\n“A lot of the early experience for me was just having people really not believe that what we were going to do was going to work,” Zuckerberg told me. “If you think about the early narratives, it was, like, ‘Well, this was just a college thing.’ Or ‘It’s not gonna be a big deal.’ Or ‘O.K., other people are using it, but it’s kind of a fad. There’s Friendster and there’s MySpace, and there will be something after,’ or whatever.” He added, “I feel like it really tests you emotionally to have constant doubt, and the assertion that you don’t know what you are doing.”\n\nIn 2006, Zuckerberg made his most unpopular decision at the fledgling company. Yahoo was offering a billion dollars to buy Facebook and, as Matt Cohler, a top aide at the time, recalls, “Our growth had stalled out.” Cohler and many others implored Zuckerberg to take the offer, but he refused. “I think nearly all of his leadership team lost faith in him and in the business,” Cohler said. Zuckerberg told me that most of his leadership “left within eighteen months. Some of them I had to fire because it was just too dysfunctional. It just completely blew up. But the thing that I learned from that is, if you stick with your values and with what you believe you want to be doing in the world, you can get through. Sometimes it will take some time, and you have to rebuild, but that’s a pretty powerful lesson.”\n\nOn several occasions, Zuckerberg stumbled when it came to issues of privacy. In 2007, Facebook started giving advertisers a chance to buy into a program called Beacon, which would announce to a user’s friends what that user was browsing for, or buying, online. Users could opt out, but many had no idea that the feature existed until it revealed upcoming holiday gifts, or, in some cases, exposed extramarital affairs. Zuckerberg apologized (“We simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize for it,” he wrote), and Beacon was withdrawn.\n\nDespite the apology, Zuckerberg was convinced that he was ahead of his users, not at odds with them. In 2010, he said that privacy was no longer a “social norm.” That year, the company found itself in trouble again after it revised its privacy controls to make most information public by default. The Federal Trade Commission cited Facebook for “engaging in unfair and deceptive practices” with regard to the privacy of user data. The company signed a consent decree pledging to establish a “comprehensive privacy program” and to evaluate it every other year for twenty years. In a post, Zuckerberg offered a qualified apology: “I think that a small number of high profile mistakes .&#160;.&#160;. have often overshadowed much of the good work we’ve done.”\n\nFacebook had adopted a buccaneering motto, “Move fast and break things,” which celebrated the idea that it was better to be flawed and first than careful and perfect. Andrew Bosworth, a former Harvard teaching assistant who is now one of Zuckerberg’s longest-serving lieutenants and a member of his inner circle, explained, “A failure can be a form of success. It’s not the form you want, but it can be a useful thing to how you learn.” In Zuckerberg’s view, skeptics were often just fogies and scolds. “There’s always someone who wants to slow you down,” he said in a commencement address at Harvard last year. “In our society, we often don’t do big things because we’re so afraid of making mistakes that we ignore all the things wrong today if we do nothing. The reality is, anything we do will have issues in the future. But that can’t keep us from starting.”\n\nZuckerberg’s disregard for criticism entered a more emphatic phase in 2010, with the release of the movie “[The Social Network](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/04/influencing-people),” an account of Facebook’s early years, written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher. Some of the film was fictionalized. It presented Zuckerberg’s motivation largely as a desire to meet girls, even though, in real life, he was dating Priscilla Chan for most of the time period covered in the movie. But other elements cut close to the truth, including the depiction of his juvenile bravado and the early feuds over ownership. Zuckerberg and Facebook had chosen not to be involved in the production, and the portrayal was unflattering. Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, is cocksure and cold, and the real Zuckerberg found the depiction hurtful. “First impressions matter a lot, and for a lot of people that was their introduction to me,” he told me. “My reaction to this, to all these things, is primarily that I perceive it through the employees.” His concern was less about how people would think of him, he said, than about “how is our company, how are our employees—these people I work with and care so much about—how are they going to process this?”\n\nBefore the movie came out, Facebook executives debated how to respond. Zuckerberg settled on a stance of effortful good cheer, renting a movie theatre to screen it for the staff. Eight years later, Facebook executives still mention what they call, resentfully, “the movie.” Sandberg, who is the company’s second most important public figure, and one of Zuckerberg’s most ardent defenders, told me, “From its facts to its essence to its portrayal, I think that was a very unfair picture. I still think it forms the basis of a lot of what people believe about Mark.”\n\nWhile the movie contributed to the fortress mentality on campus, Zuckerberg made a series of decisions that solidified his confidence in his instincts. In 2012, he paid a billion dollars for [Instagram](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/instagram), the photo-sharing service, which at the time had only thirteen employees. Outside the industry, the startup appeared wildly overpriced, but it proved to be one of the best investments in the history of the Internet. (Today, Instagram is valued at more than a hundred times what Zuckerberg paid for it, and, even more important, it is popular with young people, a cohort that shows declining interest in Facebook.) That spring, Facebook went public on the Nasdaq, at a valuation of a hundred and four billion dollars. There were technical glitches on the day of the listing, and many people doubted that the company could earn enough money to justify the valuation. The share price promptly sank. The _Wall Street Journal_ called the I.P.O. a “[fiasco](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304821304577436873952633672),” and shareholders sued Facebook and Zuckerberg. “We got a ton of criticism,” he recalled. “Our market cap got cut in half. But what I felt was, we were at a sufficient skill and complexity that it was going to take a couple years to work through the problem, but I had strong conviction that we were doing the right thing.” (Even with its recent plunge, the value of Facebook stock has more than quadrupled in the years since.)\n\nZuckerberg was happy to make sharp turns to achieve his aims. In 2011, when users started moving from desktop computers to phones, Facebook swerved toward mobile technology. Zuckerberg told employees that he would kick them out of his office if their ideas did not account for the transition. “Within a month, you literally can’t meet with Mark if you’re not bringing him a mobile product,” Bosworth recalled.\n\nIn 2014, as problems accumulated, Facebook changed its motto, “Move fast and break things,” to the decidedly less glamorous “Move fast with stable infrastructure.” Still, internally, much of the original spirit endured, and the push for haste began to take a toll in the offline world. In early 2016, Zuckerberg directed employees to accelerate the release of Facebook Live, a video-streaming service, and expanded its team of engineers from twelve to more than a hundred. When the product emerged, two months later, so did unforeseen issues: the service let users flag videos as inappropriate, but it didn’t give them a way to indicate where in a broadcast the problem appeared. As a result, Facebook Live videos of people committing suicide, or engaged in criminal activity, started circulating before reviewers had time to race through, find the issues, and take the videos down. A few months after the service launched, a Chicago man named Antonio Perkins was fatally shot on Facebook Live and the video was viewed hundreds of thousands of times.\n\nThe incident might have served as a warning to slow down, but, instead, the next day, Bosworth sent around a remarkable internal memo justifying some of Facebook’s “ugly” physical and social effects as the trade-offs necessary for growth: “Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is \\*de facto\\* good.”\n\nThis spring, after the memo [leaked to BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data), Bosworth said that he had been playing devil’s advocate, and Zuckerberg issued a statement: “Boz is a talented leader who says many provocative things. This was one that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly. We’ve never believed the ends justify the means.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nZuckerberg was also experimenting with [philanthropy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/27/gospels-of-giving-for-the-new-gilded-age). In 2010, shortly before the release of “The Social Network,” he made a high-profile gift. Appearing onstage at “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” along with Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, and Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, he announced a hundred-million-dollar donation to help Newark’s struggling public-school system. [The project](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/schooled) quickly encountered opposition from local groups that saw it as out of touch, and, eight years later, it’s generally considered a failure. In May, Ras Baraka, Newark’s mayor, said of the donation, “You can’t just cobble up a bunch of money and drop it in the middle of the street and say, ‘This is going to fix everything.’&#160;”\n\nFor all the criticism, the project has produced some measurable improvements. A Harvard study found greater gains in English than the state average, and a study by MarGrady Research, an education-policy group, found that high-school graduation rates and over-all student enrollment in Newark have risen since the donation. Zuckerberg emphasizes those results, even as he acknowledges flaws in his approach. “Your earning potential is dramatically higher if you graduate from high school versus not. That part of it, I think, is the part that worked and it was effective,” he said. “There were a bunch of other things that we tried that either were much harder than we thought or just didn’t work.” Strategies that helped him in business turned out to hurt him in education reform. “I think in a lot of philanthropy and government-related work, if you try five things and a few of them fail, then the ones that fail are going to get a lot of the attention,” he said.\n\nIn 2015, Zuckerberg and Chan pledged to spend ninety-nine per cent of their Facebook fortune “to advance human potential and promote equality for all children in the next generation.” They created the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited-liability company that gives to charity, invests in for-profit companies, and engages in political advocacy. David Plouffe said that the lessons of the Newark investment shaped the initiative’s perspective. “I think the lesson was, you have to do this in full partnership with the community, not just the leaders,” he said. “You need to have enthusiastic buy-in from superintendents, and teachers, and parents.”\n\nIn contrast to a traditional foundation, an L.L.C. can lobby and give money to politicians, without as strict a legal requirement to disclose activities. In other words, rather than trying to win over politicians and citizens in places like Newark, Zuckerberg and Chan could help elect politicians who agree with them, and rally the public directly by running ads and supporting advocacy groups. (A spokesperson for C.Z.I. said that it has given no money to candidates; it has supported ballot initiatives through a 501(c)(4) social-welfare organization.) “The whole point of the L.L.C. structure is to allow a coördinated attack,” Rob Reich, a co-director of Stanford’s Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society, told me. The structure has gained popularity in Silicon Valley but has been criticized for allowing wealthy individuals to orchestrate large-scale social agendas behind closed doors. Reich said, “There should be much greater transparency, so that it’s not dark. That’s not a criticism of Mark Zuckerberg. It’s a criticism of the law.”\n\nIn 2016, Zuckerberg announced, onstage and in a Facebook post, his intention to “help cure all disease in our children’s lifetime.” That was partly bluster: C.Z.I. is working on a slightly more realistic agenda, to “cure, prevent or manage all diseases.” The theatrics irritated some in the philanthropy world who thought that Zuckerberg’s presentation minimized the challenges, but, in general, scientists have applauded the ambition. When I asked Zuckerberg about the reception of the project, he said, “It’s funny, when I talk to people here in the Valley, you get a couple of reactions. A bunch of people have the reaction of ‘Oh, that’s obviously going to happen on its own—why don’t you just spend your time doing something else?’ And then a bunch of people have the reaction of ‘Oh, that seems almost impossible—why are you setting your sights so high?’&#160;”\n\nCharacteristically, Zuckerberg favors the optimistic scenario. “On average, every year for the last eighty years or so, I think, life expectancy has gone up by about a quarter of a year. And, if you believe that technological and scientific progress is not going to slow, there is a potential upside to speeding that up,” he said. “We’re going to get to a point where the life expectancy implied by extrapolating that out will mean that we’ll basically have been able to manage or cure all of the major things that people suffer from and die from today. Based on the data that we already see, it seems like there’s a reasonable shot.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3ce01fe0d4c650956c9]||||||\n+++\n\nI asked Bill Gates, whose private foundation is the largest in the U.S., about Zuckerberg’s objectives. “There are aspirations and then there are plans,” he said. “And plans vary in terms of their degree of realism and concreteness.” He added that Zuckerberg’s long-range goal is “very safe, because you will not be around to write the article saying that he overcommitted.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs Facebook expanded, so did its blind spots. The company’s financial future relies partly on growth in developing countries, but the platform has been a powerful catalyst of violence in fragile parts of the globe. In India, the largest market for Facebook’s WhatsApp service, hoaxes have triggered riots, lynchings, and fatal beatings. Local officials resorted to shutting down the Internet sixty-five times last year. In Libya, people took to Facebook to trade weapons, and armed groups relayed the locations of targets for artillery strikes. In Sri Lanka, after a Buddhist mob attacked Muslims this spring over a false rumor, a Presidential adviser told the _[Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/world/asia/facebook-sri-lanka-riots.html)_, “The germs are ours, but Facebook is the wind.”\n\nNowhere has the damage been starker than in [Myanmar](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Myanmar), where the Rohingya Muslim minority has been subject to brutal killings, gang rapes, and torture. In 2012, around one per cent of the country’s population had access to the Internet. Three years later, that figure had reached twenty-five per cent. Phones often came preloaded with the Facebook app, and Buddhist extremists seeking to inflame ethnic tensions with the Rohingya mastered the art of misinformation. Wirathu, a monk with a large Facebook following, sparked a deadly riot against Muslims in 2014 when he shared a fake report of a rape and warned of a “Jihad against us.” Others gamed Facebook’s rules against hate speech by fanning paranoia about demographic change. Although Muslims make up no more than five per cent of the country, a popular graphic appearing on Facebook cautioned that “when Muslims become the most powerful” they will offer “Islam or the sword.”\n\nBeginning in 2013, a series of experts on Myanmar met with Facebook officials to warn them that it was fuelling attacks on the Rohingya. David Madden, an entrepreneur based in Myanmar, delivered a presentation to officials at the Menlo Park headquarters, pointing out that the company was playing a role akin to that of the radio broadcasts that spread hatred during the Rwandan genocide. In 2016, C4ADS, a Washington-based nonprofit, published a detailed analysis of Facebook usage in Myanmar, and described a “campaign of hate speech that actively dehumanizes Muslims.” Facebook officials said that they were hiring more Burmese-language reviewers to take down dangerous content, but the company repeatedly declined to say how many had actually been hired. By last March, the situation had become dire: almost a million Rohingya had fled the country, and more than a hundred thousand were confined to internal camps. The United Nations investigator in charge of examining the crisis, which the U.N. has deemed a genocide, said, “I’m afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it was originally intended.” Afterward, when pressed, Zuckerberg repeated the claim that Facebook was “hiring dozens” of additional Burmese-language content reviewers.\n\nMore than three months later, I asked Jes Kaliebe Petersen, the C.E.O. of Phandeeyar, a tech hub in Myanmar, if there had been any progress. “We haven’t seen any tangible change from Facebook,” he told me. “We don’t know how much content is being reported. We don’t know how many people at Facebook speak Burmese. The situation is getting worse and worse here.”\n\nI saw Zuckerberg the following morning, and asked him what was taking so long. He replied, “I think, fundamentally, we’ve been slow at the same thing in a number of areas, because it’s actually the same problem. But, yeah, I think the situation in Myanmar is terrible.” It was a frustrating and evasive reply. I asked him to specify the problem. He said, “Across the board, the solution to this is we need to move from what is fundamentally a reactive model to a model where we are using technical systems to flag things to a much larger number of people who speak all the native languages around the world and who can just capture much more of the content.”\n\nI told him that people in Myanmar are incredulous that a company with Facebook’s resources has failed to heed their complaints. “We’re taking this seriously,” he said. “You can’t just snap your fingers and solve these problems. It takes time to hire the people and train them, and to build the systems that can flag stuff for them.” He promised that Facebook would have “a hundred or more Burmese-speaking people by the end of the year,” and added, “I hate that we’re in this position where we are not moving as quickly as we would like.” A few weeks after our conversation, Facebook announced that it was banning Myanmar’s Army chief and several other military officials.\n\nOver the years, Zuckerberg had come to see his ability to reject complaints as a virtue. But, by 2016, that stance had primed the company for a crisis. Tristan Harris, the design ethicist, said, “When you’re running anything like Facebook, you get criticized all the time, and you just stop paying attention to criticism if a lot of it is not well founded. You learn to treat it as naïve and uninformed.” He went on, “The problem is it also puts you out of touch with genuine criticism from people who actually understand the issues.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe 2016 election was supposed to be good for Facebook. That January, Sheryl Sandberg told investors that the election would be “a big deal in terms of ad spend,” comparable to the Super Bowl and the World Cup. According to Borrell Associates, a research and consulting firm, candidates and other political groups were on track to spend $1.4 billion online in the election, up ninefold from four years earlier.\n\nFacebook offered to “embed” employees, for free, in Presidential campaign offices to help them use the platform effectively. Clinton’s campaign said no. Trump’s said yes, and Facebook employees helped his campaign craft messages. Although Trump’s language was openly hostile to ethnic minorities, inside Facebook his behavior felt, to some executives, like just part of the distant cesspool of Washington. Americans always seemed to be choosing between a hated Republican and a hated Democrat, and Trump’s descriptions of Mexicans as rapists was simply an extension of that.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump used Facebook to raise two hundred and eighty million dollars. Just days before the election, his team paid for a voter-suppression effort on the platform. According to _Bloomberg Businessweek_, it targeted three Democratic constituencies—“idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans”—sending them videos precisely tailored to discourage them from turning out for Clinton. Theresa Hong, the Trump campaign’s digital-content director, later told an interviewer, “Without Facebook we wouldn’t have won.”\n\nAfter the election, Facebook executives fretted that the company would be blamed for the spread of fake news. Zuckerberg’s staff gave him statistics showing that the vast majority of election information on the platform was legitimate. At a tech conference a few days later, Zuckerberg was defensive. “The idea that fake news on Facebook—of which, you know, it’s a very small amount of the content—influenced the election in any way, I think, is a pretty crazy idea,” he said. To some at Facebook, Zuckerberg’s defensiveness was alarming. A former executive told [_Wired_,](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-2-years-of-hell/) “We had to really flip him on that. We realized that if we didn’t, the company was going to start heading down this pariah path.”\n\nWhen I asked Zuckerberg about his “pretty crazy” comment, he said that he was wrong to have been “glib.” He told me, “Nobody wants any amount of fake news. It is an issue on an ongoing basis, and we need to take that seriously.” But he still bristles at the implication that Facebook may have distorted voter behavior. “I find the notion that people would only vote some way because they were tricked to be almost viscerally offensive,” he said. “Because it goes against the whole notion that you should trust people and that individuals are smart and can understand their own experience and can make their own assessments about what direction they want their community to go in.”\n\nShortly after the election, Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, contacted Facebook to discuss Russian interference. “The initial reaction was completely dismissive,” he told me. But, by the spring, he sensed that the company was realizing that it had a serious problem. “They were seeing an enormous amount of Russian activity in the French elections,” Warner said. “It was getting better, but I still don’t think they were putting nearly enough resources behind this.” Warner, who made a fortune in the telecom business, added, “Most of the companies in the Valley think that policymakers, one, don’t get it, and, two, that ultimately, if they just stonewall us, then we’ll go away.”\n\nFacebook moved fitfully to acknowledge the role it had played in the election. In September of 2017, after Robert Mueller obtained a search warrant, Facebook agreed to give his office an inventory of ads linked to Russia and the details of who had paid for them. In October, Facebook disclosed that Russian operatives had published about eighty thousand posts, reaching a hundred and twenty-six million Americans.\n\nIn March, after the Cambridge Analytica news broke, Zuckerberg and Facebook were paralyzed. For five days, Zuckerberg said nothing. His personal Facebook profile offered no statements or analysis. Its most recent post was a photo of him and Chan baking hamantaschen for Purim.\n\n“I feel like we’ve let people down and that feels terrible,” he told me later. “But it goes back to this notion that we shouldn’t be making the same mistake multiple times.” He insists that fake news is less common than people imagine: “The average person might perceive, from how much we and others talk about it, that there is more than ten times as much misinformation or hoax content on Facebook than the academic measures that we’ve seen so far suggest.” He is still not convinced that the spread of misinformation had an impact on the election. “I actually don’t consider that a closed thing,” he said. “I still think that’s the kind of thing that needs to be studied.”\n\nIn conversation, Zuckerberg is, unsurprisingly, highly analytical. When he encounters a theory that doesn’t accord with his own, he finds a seam of disagreement—a fact, a methodology, a premise—and hammers at it. It’s an effective technique for winning arguments, but one that makes it difficult to introduce new information. Over time, some former colleagues say, his deputies have begun to filter out bad news from presentations before it reaches him. A former Facebook official told me, “They only want to hear good news. They don’t want people who are disagreeing with them. There is a culture of ‘You go along to get along.’&#160;”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cfbc66792cd5fab4be]||||||\n+++\n\nI once asked Zuckerberg what he reads to get the news. “I probably mostly read aggregators,” he said. “I definitely follow Techmeme”—a roundup of headlines about his industry—“and the media and political equivalents of that, just for awareness.” He went on, “There’s really no newspaper that I pick up and read front to back. Well, that might be true of most people these days—most people don’t read the physical paper—but there aren’t many news Web sites where I go to browse.”\n\nA couple of days later, he called me and asked to revisit the subject. “I felt like my answers were kind of vague, because I didn’t necessarily feel like it was appropriate for me to get into which specific organizations or reporters I read and follow,” he said. “I guess what I tried to convey, although I’m not sure if this came across clearly, is that the job of uncovering new facts and doing it in a trusted way is just an absolutely critical function for society.”\n\nZuckerberg and Sandberg have attributed their mistakes to excessive optimism, a blindness to the darker applications of their service. But that explanation ignores their fixation on growth, and their unwillingness to heed warnings. Zuckerberg resisted calls to reorganize the company around a new understanding of privacy, or to reconsider the depth of data it collects for advertisers.\n\nJames P. Steyer, the founder and C.E.O. of Common Sense Media, an organization that promotes safety in technology and media for children, visited Facebook’s headquarters in the spring of 2018 to discuss his concerns about a product called Messenger Kids, which allows children under thirteen—the minimum age to use the primary Facebook app—to make video calls and send messages to contacts that a parent approves. He met with Sandberg and Elliot Schrage, at the time the head of policy and communications. “I respect their business success, and like Sheryl personally, and I was hoping they might finally consider taking steps to better protect kids. Instead, they said that the best thing for young kids was to spend more time on Messenger Kids,” Steyer told me. “They still seemed to be in denial. Would _you_ ‘move fast and break things’ when it comes to children? To our democracy? No, because you can damage them forever.”\n\nTo some people in the company, the executives seemed concentrated not on solving the problems or on preventing the next ones but on containing the damage. Tavis McGinn, a former Google pollster, started working at Facebook in the spring of 2017, doing polls with a narrow focus: measuring the public perception of Zuckerberg and Sandberg. During the next six months, McGinn conducted eight surveys and four focus groups in three countries, collecting the kinds of measurements favored by politicians and advertisers. Facebook polled reactions to the company’s new stated mission to “bring the world closer together,” as well as to items on Zuckerberg’s social-media feed, including his writings, photographs, and even his casual banter during a back-yard barbecue broadcast on Facebook Live.\n\nIn September, McGinn resigned. In an interview, he told the Web site the Verge that he had become discouraged. “I was not going to be able to change the way that the company does business,” he said. “I couldn’t change the values. I couldn’t change the culture.” He concluded that measuring the “true social outcomes” of Facebook was of limited interest to senior staffers. “I think research can be very powerful, if people are willing to listen,” he said. “But I decided after six months that it was a waste of my time to be there. I didn’t feel great about the product. I didn’t feel proud to tell people I worked at Facebook. I didn’t feel I was helping the world.” (McGinn, who has signed a nondisclosure agreement with Facebook, declined to comment for this article.)\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn March, Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress for the first time about Facebook’s handling of user data. The hearing was scheduled for April. As the date approached, the hearing acquired the overtones of a trial.\n\nIn barely two years, the mood in Washington had shifted. Internet companies and entrepreneurs, formerly valorized as the vanguard of American ingenuity and the astronauts of our time, were being compared to Standard Oil and other monopolists of the Gilded Age. This spring, the _Wall Street Journal_ published [an article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/techs-titans-tiptoe-toward-monopoly-1527783845) that began, “Imagine a not-too-distant future in which trustbusters force Facebook to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp.” It was accompanied by a sepia-toned illustration in which portraits of Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and other tech C.E.O.s had been grafted onto overstuffed torsos meant to evoke the robber barons. In 1915, Louis Brandeis, the reformer and future Supreme Court Justice, testified before a congressional committee about the dangers of corporations large enough that they could achieve a level of near-sovereignty “so powerful that the ordinary social and industrial forces existing are insufficient to cope with it.” He called this the “curse of bigness.” Tim Wu, a Columbia law-school professor and the author of a forthcoming book inspired by Brandeis’s phrase, told me, “Today, no sector exemplifies more clearly the threat of bigness to democracy than Big Tech.” He added, “When a concentrated private power has such control over what we see and hear, it has a power that rivals or exceeds that of elected government.”\n\nShortly before Zuckerberg was due to testify, a team from the Washington law firm of WilmerHale flew to Menlo Park to run him through mock hearings and to coach him on the requisite gestures of humility. Even before the recent scandals, Bill Gates had advised Zuckerberg to be alert to the opinions of lawmakers, a lesson that Gates had learned in 1998, when Microsoft faced accusations of monopolistic behavior. Gates testified to Congress, defiantly, that “the computer-software industry is not broken, and there is no need to fix it.” Within months, the Department of Justice sued Microsoft for violating federal antitrust law, leading to three years of legal agony before a settlement was reached. Gates told me that he regretted “taunting” regulators, saying, “Not something I would choose to repeat.” He encouraged Zuckerberg to be attentive to D.C. “I said, ‘Get an office there—now.’ And Mark did, and he owes me,” Gates said. Last year, Facebook spent $11.5 million on lobbying in Washington, ranking it between the American Bankers Association and General Dynamics among top spenders.\n\nOn April 10th, when Zuckerberg arrived at the [Senate hearing](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/what-was-missing-from-mark-zuckerbergs-first-day-of-congressional-testimony), he wore a sombre blue suit, and took a seat before more than forty senators. In front of him, his notes outlined likely questions and answers, including the prospect that a senator might ask him to step down from the company. His answer, in shorthand, would be: “Founded Facebook. My decisions. I made mistakes. Big challenge, but we’ve solved problems before, going to solve this one. Already taking action.”\n\nAs it turned out, nobody asked him to resign—or much of anything difficult. Despite scattered moments of pressure, the overwhelming impression left by the event was how poorly some senators grasped the issues. In the most revealing moment, Orrin Hatch, the eighty-four-year-old Republican from Utah, demanded to know how Facebook makes money if “users don’t pay for your service.” Zuckerberg replied, “Senator, we run ads,” allowing a small smile.\n\nTo observers inclined to distrust Zuckerberg, he was evasive to the point of amnesiac—he said, more than forty times, that he would need to follow up—but when the hearing concluded, after five hours, he had emerged unscathed, and Wall Street, watching closely, rewarded him by boosting the value of Facebook’s stock by twenty billion dollars. A few days later, on the internal Facebook message board, an employee wrote that he planned to buy T-shirts reading “Senator, we run ads.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWhen I asked Zuckerberg whether policymakers might try to break up Facebook, he replied, adamantly, that such a move would be a mistake. The field is “extremely competitive,” he told me. “I think sometimes people get into this mode of ‘Well, there’s not, like, an exact replacement for Facebook.’ Well, actually, that makes it _more_ competitive, because what we really are is a system of different things: we compete with Twitter as a broadcast medium; we compete with Snapchat as a broadcast medium; we do messaging, and iMessage is default-installed on every iPhone.” He acknowledged the deeper concern. “There’s this other question, which is just, laws aside, how do we feel about these tech companies being big?” he said. But he argued that efforts to “curtail” the growth of Facebook or other Silicon Valley heavyweights would cede the field to China. “I think that anything that we’re doing to constrain them will, first, have an impact on how successful we can be in other places,” he said. “I wouldn’t worry in the near term about Chinese companies or anyone else winning in the U.S., for the most part. But there are all these places where there are day-to-day more competitive situations—in Southeast Asia, across Europe, Latin America, lots of different places.”\n\nThe rough consensus in Washington is that regulators are unlikely to try to break up Facebook. The F.T.C. will almost certainly fine the company for violations, and may consider blocking it from buying big potential competitors, but, as a former F.T.C. commissioner told me, “in the United States you’re allowed to have a monopoly position, as long as you achieve it and maintain it without doing illegal things.”\n\nFacebook is encountering tougher treatment in Europe, where antitrust laws are stronger and the history of fascism makes people especially wary of intrusions on privacy. One of the most formidable critics of Silicon Valley is the [European Union](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/european-union)’s top antitrust regulator, Margrethe Vestager. Last year, after an investigation of Google’s search engine, Vestager accused the company of giving an “illegal advantage” to its shopping service and fined it $2.7 billion, at that time the largest fine ever imposed by the E.U. in an antitrust case. In July, she added another five-billion-dollar fine for the company’s practice of requiring device makers to preinstall Google apps.\n\nIn Brussels, Vestager is a high-profile presence—nearly six feet tall, with short black-and-silver hair. She grew up in rural Denmark, the eldest child of two Lutheran pastors, and, when I spoke to her recently, she talked about her enforcement powers in philosophical terms. “What we’re dealing with, when people start doing something illegal, is exactly as old as Adam and Eve,” she said. “Human decisions very often are guided by greed, by fear of being pushed out of the marketplace, or of losing something that’s important to you. And then, if you throw power into that cocktail of greed and fear, you have something that you can recognize throughout time.”\n\nVestager told me that her office has no open cases involving Facebook, but she expressed concern that the company was taking advantage of users, beginning with terms of service that she calls “unbalanced.” She paraphrased those terms as “It’s your data, but you give us a royalty-free global license to do, basically, whatever we want.” Imagine, she said, if a brick-and-mortar business asked to copy all your photographs for its unlimited, unspecified uses. “Your children, from the very first day until the confirmation, the rehearsal dinner for the wedding, the wedding itself, the first child being baptized. You would never accept that,” she said. “But this is what you accept without a blink of an eye when it’s digital.”\n\nIn Vestager’s view, a healthy market should produce competitors to Facebook that position themselves as ethical alternatives, collecting less data and seeking a smaller share of user attention. “We need social media that will allow us to have a nonaddictive, advertising-free space,” she said. “You’re more than welcome to be successful and to dramatically outgrow your competitors if customers like your product. But, if you grow to be dominant, you have a special responsibility not to misuse your dominant position to make it very difficult for others to compete against you and to attract potential customers. Of course, we keep an eye on it. If we get worried, we will start looking.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cf477b8357353ab503]||||||\n+++\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs the pressure on Facebook has intensified, the company has been moving to fix its vulnerabilities. In December, after Sean Parker and Chamath Palihapitiya spoke publicly about the damaging psychological effects of social media, Facebook acknowledged evidence that heavy use can exacerbate anxiety and loneliness. After years of perfecting addictive features, such as “auto-play” videos, it announced a new direction: it would promote the quality, rather than the quantity, of time spent on the site. The company modified its algorithm to emphasize updates from friends and family, the kind of content most likely to promote “active engagement.” In a post, Zuckerberg wrote, “We can help make sure that Facebook is time well spent.”\n\nThe company also grappled with the possibility that it would once again become a vehicle for election-season propaganda. In 2018, hundreds of millions of people would be voting in elections around the world, including in the U.S. midterms. After years of lobbying against requirements to disclose the sources of funding for political ads, the company announced that users would now be able to look up who paid for a political ad, whom the ad targeted, and which other ads the funders had run.\n\nSamidh Chakrabarti, the product manager in charge of Facebook’s “election integrity” work, told me that the revelations about Russia’s Internet Research Agency were deeply alarming. “This wasn’t the kind of product that any of us thought that we were working on,” he said. With the midterms approaching, the company had discovered that Russia’s model for exploiting Facebook had inspired a generation of new actors similarly focussed on skewing political debate. “There are lots of copycats,” Chakrabarti said.\n\nZuckerberg used to rave about the virtues of “frictionless sharing,” but these days Facebook is working on “imposing friction” to slow the spread of disinformation. In January, the company hired Nathaniel Gleicher, the former director for cybersecurity policy on President Obama’s National Security Council, to blunt “information operations.” In July, it removed thirty-two accounts running disinformation campaigns that were traced to Russia. A few weeks later, it removed more than six hundred and fifty accounts, groups, and pages with links to Russia or Iran. Depending on your point of view, the removals were a sign either of progress or of the growing scale of the problem. Regardless, they highlighted the astonishing degree to which the security of elections around the world now rests in the hands of Gleicher, Chakrabarti, and other employees at Facebook.\n\nAs hard as it is to curb election propaganda, Zuckerberg’s most intractable problem may lie elsewhere—in the struggle over which opinions can appear on Facebook, which cannot, and who gets to decide. As an engineer, Zuckerberg never wanted to wade into the realm of content. Initially, Facebook tried blocking certain kinds of material, such as posts featuring nudity, but it was forced to create long lists of exceptions, including images of breast-feeding, “acts of protest,” and works of art. Once Facebook became a venue for political debate, the problem exploded. In April, in a call with investment analysts, Zuckerberg said glumly that it was proving “easier to build an A.I. system to detect a nipple than what is hate speech.”\n\nThe cult of growth leads to the curse of bigness: every day, a billion things were being posted to Facebook. At any given moment, a Facebook “content moderator” was deciding whether a post in, say, Sri Lanka met the standard of hate speech or whether a dispute over Korean politics had crossed the line into bullying. Zuckerberg sought to avoid banning users, preferring to be a “platform for all ideas.” But he needed to prevent Facebook from becoming a swamp of hoaxes and abuse. His solution was to ban “hate speech” and impose lesser punishments for “misinformation,” a broad category that ranged from crude deceptions to simple mistakes. Facebook tried to develop rules about how the punishments would be applied, but each idiosyncratic scenario prompted more rules, and over time they became byzantine. According to Facebook training slides published by the _Guardian_ last year, moderators were told that it was permissible to say “You are such a Jew” but not permissible to say “Irish are the best, but really French sucks,” because the latter was defining another people as “inferiors.” Users could not write “Migrants are scum,” because it is dehumanizing, but they could write “Keep the horny migrant teen-agers away from our daughters.” The distinctions were explained to trainees in arcane formulas such as “Not Protected + Quasi protected = not protected.”\n\nIn July, the issue landed, inescapably, in Zuckerberg’s lap. For years, Facebook had provided a platform to the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, whose delusions include that the parents of children killed in the [Sandy Hook school massacre](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/newtown-shooting) are paid actors with an anti-gun agenda. Facebook was loath to ban Jones. When people complained that his rants violated rules against harassment and fake news, Facebook experimented with punishments. At first, it “reduced” him, tweaking the algorithm so that his messages would be shown to fewer people, while feeding his fans articles that fact-checked his assertions.\n\nThen, in late July, Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, the parents of Noah Pozner, a child killed at Sandy Hook, published an open letter addressed “Dear Mr Zuckerberg,” in which they described “living in hiding” because of death threats from conspiracy theorists, after “an almost inconceivable battle with Facebook to provide us with the most basic of protections.” In their view, Zuckerberg had “deemed that the attacks on us are immaterial, that providing assistance in removing threats is too cumbersome, and that our lives are less important than providing a safe haven for hate.”\n\nFacebook relented, somewhat. On July 27th, it took down four of Jones’s videos and suspended him for a month. But public pressure did not let up. On August 5th, the dam broke after Apple, saying that the company “does not tolerate hate speech,” stopped distributing five podcasts associated with Jones. Facebook shut down four of Jones’s pages for “repeatedly” violating rules against hate speech and bullying. I asked Zuckerberg why Facebook had wavered in its handling of the situation. He was prickly about the suggestion: “I don’t believe that it is the right thing to ban a person for saying something that is factually incorrect.”\n\nJones seemed a lot more than factually incorrect, I said.\n\n“O.K., but I think the facts here are pretty clear,” he said, homing in. “The _initial_ questions were around misinformation.” He added, “We don’t take it down and ban people unless it’s directly inciting violence.” He told me that, after Jones was reduced, more complaints about him flooded in, alerting Facebook to older posts, and that the company was debating what to do when Apple announced its ban. Zuckerberg said, “When they moved, it was, like, O.K., we shouldn’t just be sitting on this content and these enforcement decisions. We should move on what we know violates the policy. We need to make a decision now.”\n\nIt will hardly be the last quandary of this sort. Facebook’s free-speech dilemmas have no simple answers—you don’t have to be a fan of Alex Jones to be unnerved by the company’s extraordinary power to silence a voice when it chooses, or, for that matter, to amplify others, to pull the levers of what we see, hear, and experience. Zuckerberg is hoping to erect a scalable system, an orderly decision tree that accounts for every eventuality and exception, but the boundaries of speech are a bedevilling problem that defies mechanistic fixes. The Supreme Court, defining obscenity, landed on “I know it when I see it.” For now, Facebook is making do with a Rube Goldberg machine of policies and improvisations, and opportunists are relishing it. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, seized on the ban of Jones as a fascist assault on conservatives. In a moment that was rich even by Cruz’s standards, he quoted Martin Niemöller’s famous lines about the Holocaust, saying, “As the poem goes, you know, ‘First they came for Alex Jones.’&#160;”\n\nLast week, testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sandberg said, “We now have over twenty thousand people and we are able to review reports in fifty languages, twenty-four hours a day.” (In the hallway before the session, as if to underscore the complexities ahead, Alex Jones had made a scene, heckling Senator Marco Rubio for not doing more to get him back on Facebook.) In recent years, Sandberg has gained fame for her work outside the company, including her books, “Lean In,” a best-seller on women’s empowerment, and “Option B,” which she wrote after the sudden death of her husband, Dave Goldberg. But her responsibility for the Facebook fallout is likely to grow, and her reputation as C.O.O. hinges on the implementation of changes. Many people in Silicon Valley believe that Sandberg and Facebook’s board of directors must do more to prevent the company from making another major mistake. “I know a couple of guys who are color-blind,” a prominent executive told me, “and their wives lay their clothes out for them in the morning if they don’t want to go out every day looking like Bozo the Clown. Sheryl and the board are expected to lay the clothes out for Mark.” He went on, “If you have blind spots, then you rely on the people around you to tell you where they are.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn one of our conversations, I asked Zuckerberg whether he finds it insulting when people speculate that he lacks emotions. “Insulting?” he asked, and then paused for several seconds to consider. “I don’t find it insulting. I don’t think it’s _accurate_. I mean, I definitely care a lot. There’s a difference between letting emotions drive impulsive decisions and caring.” He went on, “Ultimately, I think the reason that we built this successful thing is because we just solve problem after problem after problem, and typically you don’t do that by making impulsive, emotional decisions.”\n\nThe caricature of Zuckerberg is that of an automaton with little regard for the human dimensions of his work. The truth is something else: he decided long ago that no historical change is painless. Like Augustus, he is at peace with his trade-offs. Between speech and truth, he chose speech. Between speed and perfection, he chose speed. Between scale and safety, he chose scale. His life thus far has convinced him that he can solve “problem after problem after problem,” no matter the howling from the public it may cause.\n\nAt a certain point, the habits of mind that served Zuckerberg well on his ascent will start to work against him. To avoid further crises, he will have to embrace the fact that he’s now a protector of the peace, not a disrupter of it. Facebook’s colossal power of persuasion has delivered fortune but also peril. Like it or not, Zuckerberg is a gatekeeper. The era when Facebook could learn by doing, and fix the mistakes later, is over. The costs are too high, and idealism is not a defense against negligence.\n\nIn some sense, the “Mark Zuckerberg production”—as he called Facebook in its early years—has only just begun. Zuckerberg is not yet thirty-five, and the ambition with which he built his empire could well be directed toward shoring up his company, his country, and his name. The question is not whether Zuckerberg has the power to fix Facebook but whether he has the will; whether he will kick people out of his office—with the gusto that he once mustered for the pivot to mobile—if they don’t bring him ideas for preventing violence in Myanmar, or protecting privacy, or mitigating the toxicity of social media. He succeeded, long ago, in making Facebook great. The challenge before him now is to make it good. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark Zuckerberg","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mark-zuckerberg"},{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c7841c92e2c9b85da16","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Technology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"technology"},{"id":"5c2e1c9936cecf4019214208","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Silicon Valley","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"silicon-valley"},{"id":"5c2e1c83e56e652c90274671","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Social Media","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"social-media"},{"id":"5c2e1df92bc86f2c9a244b40","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tech Companies","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tech-companies"},{"id":"5c2e1f33397f5b30646d086e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Chief Executive Officers (C.E.O.s)","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"chief-executive-officers-ceos"},{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2016 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2016-election"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a18798b51cf59fc42477f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Profiles","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"profiles"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a02cf1c7a8e33fb390be6","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Evan Osnos joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2008 and covers politics and foreign affairs.

I failed to predict the nineteen that would move the fastest.\n\nLast Sunday, I went looking for the iPad. I was halfway through the documentary about the skinny guy who climbs cliffs with no ropes, but watching that particular movie on the couch was making me feel bad. So I had a brilliant plan. In kinship with the climber of mountains, I would prop up the iPad on the elliptical trainer that we got for my wife’s birthday.\n\nI’d left the iPad in its usual home––an overflowing basket, on a low table, of mail, stamps, power cords, and partially broken earphones. The low table, it turns out, was a mistake. Our son Ollie, age three, gets to use the iPad on airplanes, but rarely at home, a rule he regards as unspeakably cruel. Now and then, when he finds it in his grasp, he’ll enter random numbers into the passcode screen, until a parent lifts the device up and out of his tiny hands, at which point he rendeth his garments and lieth on the earth.\n\nThe iPad was not in the basket. Ollie, it turns out, had got hold of it and gone to town on the passcode, trying one idea after another, with the fury and focus of Alan Turing trying to beat the Nazis. It’s not clear how many codes Ollie tried, but, by the time he gave up, the screen said “iPad is disabled, try again in 25,536,442 minutes.” That works out to about forty-eight years. I took a picture of it with my phone, wrote a tweet asking if anyone knew how to fix it, and went downstairs to dinner.\n\n[#twitter: https://twitter.com/eosnos/status/1114651667214032896]\n\nI didn’t think much about the iPad again until the next morning, when I opened an e-mail from the news division of CTV, a Canadian television network: “We’re doing a short post on your tweet about the locked iPad—have you been able to unlock it? How did you do it?” Three minutes later, another e-mail arrived, this time from the Daily Mail Online, in London: “Could we possibly get your permission to use the image in that Tweet, and preferably a picture of you as well please?” I didn’t reply.\n\nA few minutes later, I was brushing my teeth when my wife showed me a text; a British friend was sending condolences on our iPad. He’d just seen a [story](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/8812421/dad-locked-out-ipad-25-million-minutes/) in the *Sun*, a British tabloid, headlined “*LOCK SHOCK*{: .small}: Baffled dad locked out of iPad for 25 *MILLION*{: .small} minutes after son, 3, tried to guess password.” (It was featured beside pregnancy photos of Meghan Markle.)\n\nOn social media, I discovered that the tweet about our predicament was travelling fast, kicking up the full, raucous spectrum of Internet sensibilities. Some people were [funny enough](https://twitter.com/CernerEhr/status/1116136551354961920): “What a coincidence. 25,536,442 minutes is also our current Help Desk hold wait time.” Others were [scolding](https://twitter.com/Dray180/status/1116345067898380291): “I wonder why a 3yo is in reach of an iPad. Deserved this tbh.” Some scoured the photo like the Zapruder film and pronounced it a fraud: “Its display is not Retina and the wallpaper is from the first iOS series. Great work of deceiving people!” A lot of people responded with their own desperate situations, [posting pictures](https://twitter.com/sthackrah/status/1115597819375546369?s=21) of their devices locked out for millions of minutes. (“What was the answer?” one person [asked](https://twitter.com/midget112251/status/1116163440022831104). “I am in the same boat.”)\n\nMeanwhile, the story continued to spread, to CNN, Fox News, *USA Today*, and news organizations in more languages than I recognized. A tech columnist at CNBC examined the software implications. Parents.com wondered if our child was punished. (No.) “Good Morning America” e-mailed with the subject line “Time Sensitive Request.” We got heartfelt e-mails from many strangers, such as the woman who urged us to steer our child toward science. “Obviously, your offspring has the dogged, unfailing persistence required for a future career in a research field,” she wrote.\n\nI was impressed by how many people posted substantive help, explaining that this was a problem especially with early iPads (ours is ancient)—they can have trouble with time and date, which in turn can send the lockout time soaring. They pointed me to [an article](https://www.lifewire.com/using-iphone-dfu-mode-2000656) on how to unlock it. It explained how to do a special kind of reset––connecting it to iTunes, turning the power off, and then holding and releasing the home and power buttons in a specific sequence––which put it in “Device Firmware Update” mode. We lost some data, but the iPad was usable again. The BBC asked for an update, and I reported that we’d unlocked it. Still, the story continued to spread. On Twitter, messages kept coming by the dozens, from yet further afield; people empathized [in Indonesian](https://twitter.com/FeryAr_/status/1116742248887017472) (“Ngeri juga kalo gini kejadiannya”), chuckled [in German](https://twitter.com/teleherzog/status/1116718763708174341) (“Zuviele Fehlversuche 🤣 in 48 Jahren KENNT das Gerät KEINER mehr 🤣”), and appealed to the divine [in Arabic](https://twitter.com/ronedsj/status/1116157585072193542): وdاللهي.\n\nIn the end, why did anybody care? Was it just a pleasing respite from gruelling news? Like so much of our lives with technology, the episode could be read as a reason for either optimism or gloom. In an instant, people had raged and imagined conspiracies; most did not. Many helped. Above all, the scenario, in all its ridiculousness, seemed to satisfy the low-grade anxieties that have become our universal predicament, the feeling that we’re rarely more than a few clicks away from becoming captive to the tech we love.

After committing his company to abide by the strict privacy requirements of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations (G.D.P.R.) in April, 2018, [internal documents](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/02/facebook-global-lobbying-campaign-against-data-privacy-laws-investment) showed that Facebook had been pursuing vigorous anti-regulation lobbying campaigns throughout the world. According to the *Guardian*, this included threatening to withhold investment in countries that didn’t support “Facebook friendly” laws and using the Facebook C.O.O. Sheryl Sandberg’s corporate-feminist playbook, “[Lean In](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Women-Work-Will-Lead/dp/0385349947),” to woo “hostile” female E.U. commissioners. But, on March 30th, Zuckerberg wrote an op-ed in the Washington *Post* proposing that businesses like his needed regulation in the areas of harmful content, election integrity, privacy, and data protection. It was either another public-relations ploy—this one intended to mute criticism of the social network after the terrorist attack on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, which killed fifty worshippers, was broadcast live on Facebook. Or else it was a cry for help, as it became clear, once again, that Zuckerberg and his cadre of fifteen thousand “content moderators” have little control over the platform. “At our scale,” [he wrote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-zuckerberg-the-internet-needs-new-rules-lets-start-in-these-four-areas/2019/03/29/9e6f0504-521a-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html?utm_term=.3e4f064b5bc3), “we’ll always make mistakes.”\n\nBroadcasting the murder of fifty people was obviously something more than a mistake. Facebook was able to remove millions of rebroadcasts of the Christchurch massacre, but neither its human moderators nor its A.I. filters could prevent copies from spreading virally. It’s unlikely that government regulation could have, either. When Zuckerberg writes that “I believe we need a more active role for governments and regulators,” he may be hoping that, when the platform is used maliciously, this will shift the focus from the failure of Facebook to the failure of regulation, or at least dilute the blame.\n\nZuckerberg and his team are masters of the P.R. sleight of hand. They have been paying the British newspaper the *Telegraph* [for upbeat sponsored content](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-daily-telegraph-positive-sponsored-news-stories-2019-4) about the company, including a feature titled “What action is Facebook taking to tackle terrorist content?,” which ran two days before the Christchurch attack. This week, just days after Zuckerberg called for tighter online privacy in his essay, [it was reported](https://www.thedailybeast.com/beyond-sketchy-facebook-demanding-some-new-users-email-passwords) that Facebook has been requiring some new users to hand over their personal e-mail passwords in order to use the service. The company’s 24/7 [election-interference “war room,”](https://mashable.com/article/facebook-election-war-room-empty-for-now/#KboQu12brsqt) which opened to great fanfare before the November midterms, was quietly dismantled once members of the press had traipsed through and filed their stories. \n\nSo perhaps a healthy dose of skepticism is in order when Zuckerberg writes that Facebook will be creating an independent body because “we shouldn’t make so many important decisions about speech on our own.” It’s also unclear how independent an independent body created by the company it is meant to oversee can be, or if the company will empanel known partisans in an attempt to look non-partisan, as it did a few months ago, when Facebook added the unabashedly conservative (and now defunct) *Weekly Standard* to its [fact-checking roster](https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-weekly-standard-played-facebook-and-screwed-think-progress). This has also become a fractious issue at Google, which recently named the president of the Koch-funded Heritage Foundation to its artificial-intelligence ethics advisory board, prompting an outcry from scores of [Google employees](https://medium.com/@against.transphobia/googlers-against-transphobia-and-hate-b1b0a5dbf76). (The company dismantled the board a few days later.) And, if Facebook’s independent advisory board is tasked with insuring that users uphold the company’s fuzzy, internally derived “community standards”—which, by the way, allow the “banned” conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to continue creating new Facebook pages as long as they don’t violate those standards—then it is compromised out of the gate. \n\nBusinesses typically eschew regulation. In this country, one legacy of the Reagan years is that a significant cohort of politicians and voters do as well. Regulation is often held up as an inhibitor of innovation, while the remarkable inventiveness and growth of American technology companies is attributed to the country’s lax regulatory climate. Zuckerberg suggests as much when he says that “the rules governing the Internet allowed a generation of entrepreneurs to build services that changed the world and created a lot of value in people’s lives.” The Federal Trade Commission has been especially complaisant—it is only now getting around to fining Facebook for failing to abide by its 2011 consent decree intended to protect users’ privacy. Congress, meanwhile, has made a show of inviting Zuckerberg and other tech leaders, including Sundar Pichai, the C.E.O. of Google, to its chambers, ostensibly to call them to account, but then has done nothing to check the power of their companies. \n\nThere are numerous reasons for this. As we saw from their fawning, elementary and sometimes inane questions during those hearings, few members of Congress understand the technology that they are tasked with regulating. The Office of Technology Assessment, which could have guided them, was shut down by the 104th Congress, in 1995, when the Republicans had control of both the House and Senate. More crucially, legislators are under the sway of an army of lobbyists: Google alone spent more than twenty-one million dollars on lobbying last year; together, Google, Facebook, and Amazon spent an unprecedented [forty-eight million dollars](https://www.recode.net/2019/1/23/18194328/google-amazon-facebook-lobby-record), which was an increase of seventeen per cent from the previous year, much of it to stave off regulation. (A recent tweet by the digital-rights activist and developer Aral Balkan put this in perspective, claiming that Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, had told him, at a private book event in SoHo, “I wake up every morning and I fight regulation, it’s what I do, it’s my job.”) \n\nSo far, the only significant reckoning for the tech industry has come from the European Union, which pursued Apple for tax avoidance in Ireland, resulting in a back-tax bill of [more than fourteen billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/technology/apple-tax-eu-ireland.html) dollars; challenged Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp, by issuing a [hundred-and-twenty-two-million-dollar](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/technology/facebook-european-union-fine-whatsapp.html) fine; and is currently investigating Amazon for antitrust violations. Ten years ago, the E.U.’s Commissioner for Competition, whose office has brought these actions, began investigating Google for unfair advertising practices. During most of those years, Google shut out other companies that wanted to sell ads next to the Google search bar. In 2016, the company stopped the practice after receiving what was essentially a cease-and-desist order from the E.U. But the damage was done. “For a ten-year period, Google did the wrong thing,” Margrethe Vestager, the E.U.’s commissioner for competition, told me. “It denied other companies the possibility of doing business and it denied us, as consumers, the probability that we would have other ads, better ads. And there was a high risk that, because of what it was doing, ads were more expensive. And, when ads are more expensive, the cost will rebound to us as consumers.” Last month, Vestager fined Google $1\\.7 billion in the case. All told, Google has been censured three times since 2014, when Vestager became commissioner, and has been slapped with more than nine billion dollars in fines. \n\nVestager’s reputation in the United States as the toughest cop on the tech beat—a New York *Times* headline, “Who Strikes Fear Into Silicon Valley? Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s Antitrust Enforcer,” is typical—is evidence that, for the most part, she walks the beat alone. “Your tax lady, she really hates the U.S.,” President Trump [told](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tax/2018/06/11/your-tax-lady-248338) Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, last year. (In fact, much of Vestager’s antitrust work concerns big European companies, such as the [Swedish furniture giant](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/business/ikea-tax-eu.html) *Ikea*{:.small}.) “We are trying to get a hold on this industrial revolution that’s happening right now,” Vestager told me. “It’s been the nature of every industrial revolution, where you say, ‘Wow! That’s amazing,’ and eventually you realize there are things that you have to deal with—working conditions, child labor, harmful substances in the workplace, all of that. Here it’s very important that we get up to speed quite quickly, because these are fast moving technologies, fast moving markets, and if we want our democracies to set the direction, instead of businesses doing so, it’s a matter of urgency.”\n\nThe office of the E.U. Commissioner for Competition is not a regulatory body. It doesn’t make rules or pass laws. Instead, it is reactive, using laws on the books—especially in the antitrust area—in the interest of fairness. And, yet, it’s possible to see something of Europe’s approach in Senator Elizabeth Warren’s recent [proposal to break up Big Tech](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c). In a white paper published on Medium, last month, Warren lays out an existential rationale for her argument, writing that “we must ensure that today’s tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies, and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy.” She then diagnoses the problem: tech companies have used mergers and proprietary marketplaces to limit competition. That is how the five Big Tech companies—Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft—have grown their businesses. They have hoovered up four hundred thirty-six companies during the past ten years, almost all without antitrust reviews. Facebook even deployed [an app](https://theintercept.com/2019/04/01/elizabeth-warren-tech-regulation-2020/) that looked for rivals that it could either buy or kill.\n\nOther senators, most notably Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, who issued his [own white paper](https://www.axios.com/mark-warner-google-facebook-regulation-policy-paper-023d4a52-2b25-4e44-a87c-945e73c637fa.html) last July, have attempted to take “the frightful five” to task for business practices that have compromised both privacy and democracy. But Warren offers a more resolute strategy: to designate as a “platform utility” any company with global revenue above twenty-five billion dollars that operates an online marketplace, exchange, or method of connecting third-parties, and prohibit them from owning both the platform and its users. This would include Google’s search engine, its ad business, and Amazon’s Marketplace. Companies that fail to follow these requirements would be fined and made to pay back ill-gotten gains. Twenty-five billion is an arbitrary number, but it’s a big one, which is the point. It would encompass the behemoths with gargantuan appetites, which are destined to swallow both competition and consumers. Warren also proposes reviving antitrust laws to uncouple anti-competitive mergers, like Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp, and Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods and Zappos. These are strong measures that have not won the senator any friends in the tech community or, as The Intercept has pointed out, among journalists and scholars who receive funding from it.

In early interviews with David Kirkpatrick, the author of “[The Facebook Effect](https://www.amazon.com/Facebook-Effect-Inside-Company-Connecting/dp/1439102120/),” [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/17/can-mark-zuckerberg-fix-facebook-before-it-breaks-democracy), the company’s co-founder and C.E.O., envisioned a challenge to the tools of corporate and political camouflage. “When there’s more openness, with everyone being able to express their opinion very quickly,” he said, “it puts the onus on companies and organizations to be more good, and more trustworthy.” \n\nAs the company grew, it sought to maintain its outsider ethos. In a letter to potential investors, in 2012, [Zuckerberg proclaimed](https://www.wired.com/2012/02/zuck-letter/), “We have cultivated a unique culture and management approach that we call the Hacker Way.” It reached beyond the hacker ethos of ingenious engineering, he explained, to shape the company’s internal culture. “Hacker culture is also extremely open and meritocratic. Hackers believe that the best idea and implementation should always win—not the person who is best at lobbying for an idea or the person who manages the most people.” In recent years, the company has sought to stay true to its hacker DNA. At weekly all-hands meetings, Zuckerberg has highlighted a “fix of the week,” celebrating the in-house esoteric technical interventions that the rest of the company may have overlooked. \n\nYet during the past two years the image of a nimble, idealistic upstart has steadily eroded, as the company has strained to make changes that would protect user privacy and prevent the spread of disinformation. On Wednesday, the idea of a company dedicated to “openness” took another blow. [A *Times* investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html) by a team of reporters found that Facebook has engaged in a multi-pronged campaign to “delay, deny and deflect” efforts to hold the company accountable. ([In a statement](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/11/new-york-times-update/) issued on Thursday, Facebook said that the piece contains “a number of inaccuracies” about the timing and the motives behind its actions.) \n\nSome of the *Times’* account is, by now, familiar. Members of Congress, for instance, have long complained that Facebook rebuffed early efforts to investigate interference in the 2016 election. (“The initial reaction was completely dismissive,” Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, [told me last summer](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/17/can-mark-zuckerberg-fix-facebook-before-it-breaks-democracy).) But the piece contained many new details about Facebook’s use of decidedly swampy political public-relations and lobbying techniques. To blunt critics in Congress, Facebook relied on Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, whose daughter works at the company; it also hired Warner’s former chief of staff to lobby against a Senate bill introduced by Warner and Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat, which would expand federal regulation over online political advertising. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, made a personal appeal to Klobuchar, who had lent support to Sandberg’s “[Lean In](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Women-Work-Will-Lead/dp/0385349947/)” project, which promotes women’s empowerment in the workplace. \n\nThe most disturbing revelation is that Facebook employed Definers Public Affairs, a conservative Washington-based consultant, to promote negative stories about Facebook’s competitors by pushing them on the [NTK Network](https://ntknetwork.com/about-us/), which calls itself “a unique news website that brings together data points from all platforms to tell the whole story.” NTK is not, in fact, a news Web site; it shares offices and staff with Definers. As the *Times* reported, “Many NTK Network stories are written by staff members at Definers or America Rising, the company’s political opposition-research arm, to attack their clients’ enemies. While the NTK Network does not have a large audience of its own, its content is frequently picked up by popular conservative outlets, including Breitbart.” In other words, Facebook employed a political P.R. firm that circulated exactly the kind of pseudo-news that Facebook has, in its announcements, sought to prevent from eroding Americans’ confidence in fact versus fiction. \n\nOn another front, Definers also sought to discredit Freedom from Facebook, a nonprofit opposition group, by encouraging reporters to write about its ties to George Soros, the liberal financier who is a subject of obsessive, often conspiratorial attention in conservative circles. On Thursday, Sarah Miller, a spokesperson for Freedom from Facebook, told me, “Congress and the Federal Trade Commission should come to terms with the fact that Facebook will never change, unless they force it to—and they should, without delay, to protect our democracy.” (On Thursday, as the report of the P.R. firm’s activities stirred criticism, Facebook said that it had ended its relationship. The company said that it had not asked the firm to circulate false stories.)\n\nThe portrait of Facebook presented in the *Times*, as in other reports over the past two years, is no longer that of a hacker but, rather, that of a practiced participant in this golden age of manipulation, in which influential organizations—companies, candidates, murky political actors—use their power to shape political outcomes in ways they don’t disclose and that the public rarely fully understands. Facebook appears less a company outside the bounds of big-money P.R. and politics than one operating squarely within them—a contradiction that Zuckerberg, so far, has been willing to accept.  \n\nIn the short run, the *Times* story will revive questions about whether Zuckerberg and Sandberg should remain at the head of the company. But nobody involved with Facebook thinks they are at obvious risk of losing their jobs, because they maintain the support of a board of directors that some observers believe has been far too passive in the face of Facebook’s stumbles. \n\nThe larger risks are in the long term. In Silicon Valley, where talented staff are in high demand, Facebook’s biggest problem is declining morale. Many people joined the company in the hope of disrupting antique structures of power and deception—a spirit that Facebook, in its early days, called “radical transparency.” Very little of its Washington operation fits that image. As the company’s troubles mounted this year, [TechCrunch reported](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/30/loose-lips-sink-apps/), “If employees wake up each day unsure whether Facebook’s mission is actually harming the world, they won’t stay.” Others will stay, but will just “rest and vest,” vegetating until they gain ownership of their stock options. For employees who took pride in joining Facebook, it is an uncomfortable phase. Nobody wants to have to apologize for their employer. A former Facebook executive told me, “They want to be proud at Thanksgiving.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark Zuckerberg","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mark-zuckerberg"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a02cf1c7a8e33fb390be6","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Evan Osnos joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2008 and covers politics and foreign affairs.

After committing his company to abide by the strict privacy requirements of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations (G.D.P.R.) in April, 2018, [internal documents](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/02/facebook-global-lobbying-campaign-against-data-privacy-laws-investment) showed that Facebook had been pursuing vigorous anti-regulation lobbying campaigns throughout the world. According to the *Guardian*, this included threatening to withhold investment in countries that didn’t support “Facebook friendly” laws and using the Facebook C.O.O. Sheryl Sandberg’s corporate-feminist playbook, “[Lean In](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Women-Work-Will-Lead/dp/0385349947),” to woo “hostile” female E.U. commissioners. But, on March 30th, Zuckerberg wrote an op-ed in the Washington *Post* proposing that businesses like his needed regulation in the areas of harmful content, election integrity, privacy, and data protection. It was either another public-relations ploy—this one intended to mute criticism of the social network after the terrorist attack on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, which killed fifty worshippers, was broadcast live on Facebook. Or else it was a cry for help, as it became clear, once again, that Zuckerberg and his cadre of fifteen thousand “content moderators” have little control over the platform. “At our scale,” [he wrote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-zuckerberg-the-internet-needs-new-rules-lets-start-in-these-four-areas/2019/03/29/9e6f0504-521a-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html?utm_term=.3e4f064b5bc3), “we’ll always make mistakes.”\n\nBroadcasting the murder of fifty people was obviously something more than a mistake. Facebook was able to remove millions of rebroadcasts of the Christchurch massacre, but neither its human moderators nor its A.I. filters could prevent copies from spreading virally. It’s unlikely that government regulation could have, either. When Zuckerberg writes that “I believe we need a more active role for governments and regulators,” he may be hoping that, when the platform is used maliciously, this will shift the focus from the failure of Facebook to the failure of regulation, or at least dilute the blame.\n\nZuckerberg and his team are masters of the P.R. sleight of hand. They have been paying the British newspaper the *Telegraph* [for upbeat sponsored content](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-daily-telegraph-positive-sponsored-news-stories-2019-4) about the company, including a feature titled “What action is Facebook taking to tackle terrorist content?,” which ran two days before the Christchurch attack. This week, just days after Zuckerberg called for tighter online privacy in his essay, [it was reported](https://www.thedailybeast.com/beyond-sketchy-facebook-demanding-some-new-users-email-passwords) that Facebook has been requiring some new users to hand over their personal e-mail passwords in order to use the service. The company’s 24/7 [election-interference “war room,”](https://mashable.com/article/facebook-election-war-room-empty-for-now/#KboQu12brsqt) which opened to great fanfare before the November midterms, was quietly dismantled once members of the press had traipsed through and filed their stories. \n\nSo perhaps a healthy dose of skepticism is in order when Zuckerberg writes that Facebook will be creating an independent body because “we shouldn’t make so many important decisions about speech on our own.” It’s also unclear how independent an independent body created by the company it is meant to oversee can be, or if the company will empanel known partisans in an attempt to look non-partisan, as it did a few months ago, when Facebook added the unabashedly conservative (and now defunct) *Weekly Standard* to its [fact-checking roster](https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-weekly-standard-played-facebook-and-screwed-think-progress). This has also become a fractious issue at Google, which recently named the president of the Koch-funded Heritage Foundation to its artificial-intelligence ethics advisory board, prompting an outcry from scores of [Google employees](https://medium.com/@against.transphobia/googlers-against-transphobia-and-hate-b1b0a5dbf76). (The company dismantled the board a few days later.) And, if Facebook’s independent advisory board is tasked with insuring that users uphold the company’s fuzzy, internally derived “community standards”—which, by the way, allow the “banned” conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to continue creating new Facebook pages as long as they don’t violate those standards—then it is compromised out of the gate. \n\nBusinesses typically eschew regulation. In this country, one legacy of the Reagan years is that a significant cohort of politicians and voters do as well. Regulation is often held up as an inhibitor of innovation, while the remarkable inventiveness and growth of American technology companies is attributed to the country’s lax regulatory climate. Zuckerberg suggests as much when he says that “the rules governing the Internet allowed a generation of entrepreneurs to build services that changed the world and created a lot of value in people’s lives.” The Federal Trade Commission has been especially complaisant—it is only now getting around to fining Facebook for failing to abide by its 2011 consent decree intended to protect users’ privacy. Congress, meanwhile, has made a show of inviting Zuckerberg and other tech leaders, including Sundar Pichai, the C.E.O. of Google, to its chambers, ostensibly to call them to account, but then has done nothing to check the power of their companies. \n\nThere are numerous reasons for this. As we saw from their fawning, elementary and sometimes inane questions during those hearings, few members of Congress understand the technology that they are tasked with regulating. The Office of Technology Assessment, which could have guided them, was shut down by the 104th Congress, in 1995, when the Republicans had control of both the House and Senate. More crucially, legislators are under the sway of an army of lobbyists: Google alone spent more than twenty-one million dollars on lobbying last year; together, Google, Facebook, and Amazon spent an unprecedented [forty-eight million dollars](https://www.recode.net/2019/1/23/18194328/google-amazon-facebook-lobby-record), which was an increase of seventeen per cent from the previous year, much of it to stave off regulation. (A recent tweet by the digital-rights activist and developer Aral Balkan put this in perspective, claiming that Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, had told him, at a private book event in SoHo, “I wake up every morning and I fight regulation, it’s what I do, it’s my job.”) \n\nSo far, the only significant reckoning for the tech industry has come from the European Union, which pursued Apple for tax avoidance in Ireland, resulting in a back-tax bill of [more than fourteen billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/technology/apple-tax-eu-ireland.html) dollars; challenged Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp, by issuing a [hundred-and-twenty-two-million-dollar](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/technology/facebook-european-union-fine-whatsapp.html) fine; and is currently investigating Amazon for antitrust violations. Ten years ago, the E.U.’s Commissioner for Competition, whose office has brought these actions, began investigating Google for unfair advertising practices. During most of those years, Google shut out other companies that wanted to sell ads next to the Google search bar. In 2016, the company stopped the practice after receiving what was essentially a cease-and-desist order from the E.U. But the damage was done. “For a ten-year period, Google did the wrong thing,” Margrethe Vestager, the E.U.’s commissioner for competition, told me. “It denied other companies the possibility of doing business and it denied us, as consumers, the probability that we would have other ads, better ads. And there was a high risk that, because of what it was doing, ads were more expensive. And, when ads are more expensive, the cost will rebound to us as consumers.” Last month, Vestager fined Google $1\\.7 billion in the case. All told, Google has been censured three times since 2014, when Vestager became commissioner, and has been slapped with more than nine billion dollars in fines. \n\nVestager’s reputation in the United States as the toughest cop on the tech beat—a New York *Times* headline, “Who Strikes Fear Into Silicon Valley? Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s Antitrust Enforcer,” is typical—is evidence that, for the most part, she walks the beat alone. “Your tax lady, she really hates the U.S.,” President Trump [told](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tax/2018/06/11/your-tax-lady-248338) Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, last year. (In fact, much of Vestager’s antitrust work concerns big European companies, such as the [Swedish furniture giant](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/business/ikea-tax-eu.html) *Ikea*{:.small}.) “We are trying to get a hold on this industrial revolution that’s happening right now,” Vestager told me. “It’s been the nature of every industrial revolution, where you say, ‘Wow! That’s amazing,’ and eventually you realize there are things that you have to deal with—working conditions, child labor, harmful substances in the workplace, all of that. Here it’s very important that we get up to speed quite quickly, because these are fast moving technologies, fast moving markets, and if we want our democracies to set the direction, instead of businesses doing so, it’s a matter of urgency.”\n\nThe office of the E.U. Commissioner for Competition is not a regulatory body. It doesn’t make rules or pass laws. Instead, it is reactive, using laws on the books—especially in the antitrust area—in the interest of fairness. And, yet, it’s possible to see something of Europe’s approach in Senator Elizabeth Warren’s recent [proposal to break up Big Tech](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c). In a white paper published on Medium, last month, Warren lays out an existential rationale for her argument, writing that “we must ensure that today’s tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies, and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy.” She then diagnoses the problem: tech companies have used mergers and proprietary marketplaces to limit competition. That is how the five Big Tech companies—Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft—have grown their businesses. They have hoovered up four hundred thirty-six companies during the past ten years, almost all without antitrust reviews. Facebook even deployed [an app](https://theintercept.com/2019/04/01/elizabeth-warren-tech-regulation-2020/) that looked for rivals that it could either buy or kill.\n\nOther senators, most notably Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, who issued his [own white paper](https://www.axios.com/mark-warner-google-facebook-regulation-policy-paper-023d4a52-2b25-4e44-a87c-945e73c637fa.html) last July, have attempted to take “the frightful five” to task for business practices that have compromised both privacy and democracy. But Warren offers a more resolute strategy: to designate as a “platform utility” any company with global revenue above twenty-five billion dollars that operates an online marketplace, exchange, or method of connecting third-parties, and prohibit them from owning both the platform and its users. This would include Google’s search engine, its ad business, and Amazon’s Marketplace. Companies that fail to follow these requirements would be fined and made to pay back ill-gotten gains. Twenty-five billion is an arbitrary number, but it’s a big one, which is the point. It would encompass the behemoths with gargantuan appetites, which are destined to swallow both competition and consumers. Warren also proposes reviving antitrust laws to uncouple anti-competitive mergers, like Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp, and Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods and Zappos. These are strong measures that have not won the senator any friends in the tech community or, as The Intercept has pointed out, among journalists and scholars who receive funding from it. It is also probably not the kind of regulation Zuckerberg has in mind.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Facebook","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c22d4972cd5b83297","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7c22d4972cd5b83297","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Amazon","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"amazon"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Amazon","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"amazon"},{"id":"5c2e1c84ee7fe02cbd163345","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c84ee7fe02cbd163345","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Google","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"google"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Google","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"google"},{"id":"5c2e1ca436cecf4019214219","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1ca436cecf4019214219","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Apple","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"apple"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Apple","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"apple"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark

She’d already surreptitiously entered the site’s database through what is known as an SQL injection. “First, you open the site,” she explained, “then you type a few lines of code into the search bar, and you can delete things and change votes. I deleted Trump. I deleted every single vote for him.”\n\n \n\nLewis was visiting an event at the conference run by R00tz Asylum, a nonprofit that teaches hacking to kids, where organizers had replicated thirteen Secretary of State Web sites and invited kids to hack them. The day the conference began, as programmers were finishing coding the sites, the National Association of Secretaries of State issued a press release complaining that Def Con “utilizes a pseudo environment which in no way replicates state election systems, networks, or physical security.” That was true enough—these sites were only look-alikes—but they were constructed from data scraped from the actual state sites, and contained known vulnerabilities that had been exploited by hackers in the past. One of the organizers, Jake Braun, rolled his eyes when I asked him about the association’s letter. “It’s totally tone-deaf,” he said. “A nation-state is literally hacking our democracy—wouldn’t you want to take any help you could possibly get? If they don’t think that the Russians are not doing what we’re doing here all year, as opposed to just a weekend, then they are fucking idiots, right?”\n\n \n\nLast year, Braun and a group of other cybersecurity researchers created Def Con’s first-ever Voting Village, a conference within the conference, devoted to election security and its evil twin, election insecurity. Def Con would bring  more than twenty-five-thousand of the most avid hackers in the world together, jamming the halls of Caesars Palace, and organizers saw an opportunity to show the American public, still reeling from news of Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, how easily voting machines could be compromised. For last year’s conference, Braun and his colleagues purchased  roughly two dozen voting machines from government auction sites and eBay, and every single one was successfully hacked, some within minutes.\n\n \n\nThis year, the Voting Village featured nearly four dozen machines, and, again, their vulnerabilities were on full display. (By lunchtime on the first day, one of the machines had been reprogrammed to project an image of the Illuminati.) “To me, the real value is that everyone who comes through here, the thousands of people, will be leaving with very specialized expertise that can be applied down the road to future systems,” Matt Blaze, another organizer, and a professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania, said. “It’s an incredible opportunity to expand the pool of experts who understand how they work and know how to evaluate them.”\n\n        \t\n\nBlaze and I were in a windowless conference room on the lower level of Caesars, surrounded by dozens of people earnestly attempting to mess with the different voting-machine models, many of which are still in use around the country, despite well-known security flaws. Nearby, another group of hackers was gathered on what was being called the cyber range, a virtual state-election system, based partly on the one used in Cook County, Illinois. (Hackers breached election systems in Illinois in 2016\\.) The idea was for attackers to try to break through the system’s firewalls and steal voter-registration data, and for defenders to try to stop them. “We’re using this to train the election officials who are here,” Harri Hursti, another organizer, had told me earlier, noting that some sixty-six hundred election officials had been invited to Vegas. Only about a hundred had actually responded and shown up. “They can see through the eyes of the attacker, they see what this environment looks like when you are the bad guys. You start to think how to defend it. You get the muscle memory.”\n\n \n\nVoter-registration databases, like the one in the cyber range and the ones built for the young R00tz Asylum hackers, are rich targets for hackers. “If we look at what happened in 2016, that was all about poking the back-office systems and support systems,” Hursti said. During the 2016 election, Russian operatives [targeted](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/when-russian-hackers-targeted-the-u-s-election-infrastructure/?__twitter_impression=true) election systems in twenty states. Change a letter in the spelling of a voter’s name, change a house number, strike someone from the registry altogether, and when they show up at the polls they’re going to be turned away. This is crucial: votes don’t need to be changed and voting machines don’t need to be tampered with for an election to be hacked.\n\n \n\nAmerican elections are overseen by the states and administered by municipalities. Offers of help from the federal government to “harden” voting systems have, in some cases, been met with suspicion by local and state officials wary of losing their autonomy. Even where that’s not the case, the Department of Homeland Security, the federal agency in charge of election security, can help states or municipalities only if they request assistance, and its recommendations, like those of another federal agency, the Election Assistance Commission, are not mandatory. But local election officials often lack the expertise needed to evaluate their systems’ vulnerabilities and, in addition, they have been known to be careless about securing those systems. Software updates go uninstalled; machines are left unguarded and unlocked; election programming and vote tabulation are often outsourced to third-party venders that may have their own vulnerabilities. (According to a leaked National Security Agency document, in 2016, Russian hackers broke into VR Systems, a Tallahassee-based election-technology vender that services eight states, including Florida, where it does work for fifty-eight of the state’s sixty-seven counties. The company said a review found no evidence of a breach.) And local officials have been known to be under the sway of the election-machine manufacturers, who wine and dine and lobby them in an effort to snag their business.\n\n \n\nThose same manufacturers have been reluctant to admit flaws in their products, and eager to promote the myth that machines that are not connected to the Internet are not susceptible to hacking. At the start of Def Con, Election Systems and Software (ES&S), the largest voting-machine company in the country, sent a letter to its customers, assuring them that the unfettered access hackers would have at Def Con was nothing like what happens on election day. “Physical security measures make it extremely unlikely that an unauthorized person, or a person with malicious intent, could ever access a voting machine,” the letter said. But the work of security researchers suggests otherwise.\n\n \n\nOn the second day of Def Con, J. Alex Halderman, a computer-science professor at the University of Michigan, stood by the door of the Voting Village, encouraging everyone who came through to cast a vote for either George Washington or Benedict Arnold in a mock election he was running using a common ES&S-owned touch-screen voting machine, the AccuVote-TSX. The AccuVote is most studied electronic voting machine in the country, Halderman explained, as people pressed their fingers to the screen and watched it register their vote.\n\n \n\n“I don’t know how we ended up with such a treasonous group,” Hursti said, as the vote tallies ticked up and up for Arnold. Actually, he conceded, he did. The election was rigged. Halderman had infected the machine—which was not connected to the Internet—with software that registered every vote for Washington as a vote for his rival. Because the AccuVote is a Direct-Recording Electronic device (D.R.E.), which provides no physical record of votes cast, there was no way to know what the real tally had been.\n\nLater in the day, Halderman told an audience how he’d put the fix in for Arnold by adding some lines of code to the external media card that is used to set up the AccuVote for an election. It was a quick, simple, and undetectable modification.\n\n“I was part of a study in California where the Secretary of State in 2007 brought together a group of respected security experts to do a code review of all of the election equipment in the state,” he said. “This is an excerpt from one of the reports about this machine, the AccuVote-TSX, and it details some of its vulnerabilities: multiple buffer overflows, software updates without authentication, interpreted code, things that could be exploited by voters,”—including the ability to erase votes using a paperclip—“things that could be exploited from the memory card. You can forge the voter cards. Inadequate randomization of the ballots, so ballot secrecy can be compromised. All of this stuff. This was in 2007 and there are pages and pages of elaborate technical documentation about these vulnerabilities. California decertified the machines—they wouldn't use them anymore. But other states”—eighteen, in fact—“continue to use them.”\n\nHalderman and his fellow-researchers have long promoted an uncomplicated and inexpensive way to protect against election hacking, one that might seem out of place among Def Con’s high tech élite: use paper. “The simple defense and I think the most important defense that we can roll out in the pragmatic form today is to make sure that every vote is backed by a piece of paper and that all states audit that paper to a high level of statistical certainty to make sure that it reflects the same outcome the computers gave us,” Halderman told the crowd, repeating points he’d made last year while testifying to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nThere was a brief moment during which it seemed that Congress was listening. Last December, Senators James Lankford and Amy Klobuchar—a Republican and a Democrat—introduced the Secure Elections Act (SEA), a measure intended to provide guidelines and funds to help local election jurisdictions defend their systems from attack. When it was first proposed, the Act included language that encouraged election officials to phase out paperless D.R.E. voting machines and to implement regular post-election audits comparing reported results with a sample of the paper ballots. Early this week—when it appeared that that language was going to be stripped out of the bill because of pressure coming from voting-machine manufacturers—election-integrity groups, including the National Election Defense Coalition and Verified Voting, pulled their support for the bill. On Wednesday, when the bill was scheduled for markup by the Senate Rules Committee, it was suddenly sidelined and “postponed until further notice,” [reportedly](https://www.yahoo.com/news/white-house-blocks-bill-protect-elections-173459278.html) at the behest of the White House.\n\nIf, prior to 2016, reluctance to fix the American voting system could be chalked up to bureaucratic intransigence, corporate lobbying, or public apathy, the events of 2016 should have changed that. Instead, led by a President who refuses to embrace the intelligence community’s findings about the penetration of our  election system by Russian state actors, and backed up by a Republican Congress that has continually stymied efforts at reform, election security has become—foolishly and dangerously—a partisan issue. Without it, democracy doesn’t stand a chance.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c872710c62d10815427","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Election Hacking","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"election-hacking"}],"sections":[{"id":"5a8c99f952e589162b850cbc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Dispatch","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"dispatch"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a5ac2e2e17730741c5fa","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sue Halpern, a contributing writer covering politics and technology, has been writing for *The New Yorker* since 2005.

Six months later, at the end of January, biologists attending the Trinational Monarch Science Meeting, in Mexico City, confirmed what I and many others had been seeing throughout the summer and fall: the eastern monarch population was a hundred and forty-four per cent larger than it had been a year earlier. The announcement offered a modicum of hope amid dire warnings of mass extinctions and ecological catastrophe. Just two weeks earlier, the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation had issued a finding that the monarch population west of the Rockies dropped by around ninety per cent in the past year and is on the verge of collapse.\n\nMonarch butterflies migrate. Though they weigh less than a gram, they travel thousands of miles each fall to overwintering sites that provide the right microclimate to enable them to survive for months with little food or water. To track these migration patterns, citizen scientists have been gluing small tags on monarchs’ wings since the nineteen-fifties. The data from recovered tags is continually overlaid on maps that show where the butterflies are going and where they are coming from. That’s how we now know that monarchs east of the Rockies typically start the journey in Canada and the upper Midwest, aiming for the Oyamel-fir forests in Mexico’s Transverse Neovolcanic Mountains. In the spring, the butterflies lay eggs in Texas before dying; successive generations move northward in a kind of relay race that follows the proliferation of milkweed, their host plant. Monarchs that begin their journey west of the Rockies do something similar: after wintering on the coast of California, shielded by stands of eucalyptus or Monterey pine, they move inland to the Central Valley, but also north to Washington State and southern British Columbia, and to Nevada, Arizona, Idaho, and possibly Montana.\n\nOne day in July, walking around our pond as my dog hunted for frogs, I watched two monarchs mate overhead, and, when they separated, I followed the female as she laid an egg on the underside of a nearby milkweed leaf. Milkweed is the monarch’s host plant because it contains a toxin that is poisonous to the butterfly’s predators. Monarch caterpillars chew the leaves and ingest the poison, which will protect the butterflies that they eventually become. I took the leaf with the egg and brought it inside. \n\nFour days later, the egg, which was white and approximately the size of a grain of sand, was gone, and in its place, barely visible, was the tiniest yellow-black-and-white caterpillar, so small that my husband had no idea where it was when I showed him. A few days, a few molts, and a few milkweed leaves later, the caterpillar was about a half-inch long and fattening up, following a timetable nearly as reliable as a Swiss watch. Another molt followed, and the caterpillar unzipped, then discarded, its striped jacket. Underneath, there was an identical one, one size larger. This phase of the metamorphosis happened to coincide with the death of Lincoln Brower, an emeritus professor of zoology who the *Times*, in its obituary, rightly called the “champion of the Monarch butterfly.” I attached a small sign, which read “The Lincoln Bedroom,” to the enclosure that I’d made for the caterpillar. I started to refer to the caterpillar as Lincoln, too—an anthropomorphism that I hoped Professor Brower, with whom I’d travelled to Mexico a number of times to see the butterflies, would have forgiven.\n\nIn 1995, Brower, who was then at the University of Florida, published a paper in the *Journal of the Lepidopterists’ Society*, explaining that while the monarch butterfly was not an endangered species—it can also be found in Hawaii, the Caribbean, Spain, Portugal, Australia and New Zealand—its North American migration patterns east of the Rockies were at grave risk of disappearing. In that paper, he called it an “endangered biological phenomenon.” Less than two decades later, in 2013, that danger appeared to have come to fruition, when that winter’s monarch population covered less than three acres of the Mexican forest, down from around twenty acres ten years earlier.\n\nAt the recent Monarch Science meeting, in Mexico City, when researchers reported that this year’s migration covered six hectares, or nearly fifteen acres, “people were cheering,” Chip Taylor, an emeritus professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Kansas, said. This year was not only a banner year for eastern monarchs, it was one for tagging as well. According to Taylor, who, since 1992, has run Monarch Watch, the most prolific monarch-tagging program in the world, four hundred thousand tags were distributed in 2018, one and a half times as many as the year before. Lincoln Brower’s great friend and occasional collaborator, the Mexican poet Homero Aridjis, another monarch champion, told me in an e-mail that he was seeing aggregations of monarchs in the mountains near his boyhood home of Contepec for the first time in a decade.\n\nThough this is all encouraging, a single year is not a trend, and scientists remain concerned about the viability of the migration. “We should celebrate the fact that we go up to this six-hectare number, and people who are living in areas where monarchs breed really noticed them this summer,” Karen Oberhauser, the director of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum, who researches monarchs, told me. “It illustrates the fact that they have this incredible potential.” But a population swing in the opposite direction can happen, too, she said. Oberhauser and her research associates have found that there is an underlying threat from habitat loss. (One study estimated that two hundred and twenty three million milkweed stems were lost in the Midwest between 2008 and 2016.) According to the World Wildlife Fund, six hectares is just enough to sustain a viable population in North America.\n\nTaylor has a one-word explanation for why 2018 was an especially good year for eastern monarchs, and why that good year likely portends bad ones to come: temperature. In March, when the monarchs arrived in Texas from Mexico, the mean temperatures were 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, which should have blown the butterflies all the way to Kansas.The butterflies couldn’t go farther north, though, because it was too cold in northern Texas. “I looked at the weather every day and I’d say, ‘damn, that’s good. Keep your babies in Texas,’” Taylor said. In May, the temperatures were optimal as the butterflies moved north, and they were ideal in the summer as monarchs spread out across their breeding range. Then, in the fall, as the butterflies headed south, those numbers were favorable, too. “What we had this year is everything was positive in every one of those stages,” Taylor told me. “This is why I say this is not likely to happen again—because you’re not likely to see a pattern like this again.”\n\nWest of the Rockies, the number of monarchs overwintering in California is estimated to be around twenty thousand, down eighty-six per cent since last year, which “isn’t completely unprecedented,” Emma Pelton, a researcher with the Xerces Society, told me. “I’ve looked back at data between 1980 and today, and there have been other instances where we’ve had a single-year drop of this magnitude. But the difference is that this is all in the context of a ninety-seven per cent decline since the nineteen-eighties.” The current situation, Pelton added, is considered “a quasi-extinction.”  There may not be enough butterflies to repopulate the range. If that happens, there will still be western monarchs, but they will be increasingly hard to find. “That would be like losing all the rhinos, except the rhinos in the zoos,” Pelton said. “Really, the threat is that we’re going to lose migration.” \n\nIn many ways, the stressors compromising western monarchs are the same as those affecting monarchs east of the Rockies: habitat loss both in the overwintering sites and along the migratory pathways; the proliferation of herbicides and insecticides, especially in wide swaths of the agricultural Midwest and the Central Valley; and increased temperatures due to climate change. But added to these are a protracted drought, enormous wildfires, and the propagation of non-native, tropical milkweed that carries a deadly parasite. Monarchs are “a very resilient species,” Taylor said. “It survived long periods of negative conditions.” The question now, in the western United States, is if the butterflies are resilient enough to rebound from such a precipitous decline.\n\nRobert Michael Pyle, the founder of the Xerces Society and an expert on the western monarch migration, thinks that they may be, but for an unlikely reason. The western migration may be an accident of happenstance, and its fate may be tied to the fate of the eastern monarchs in the Mexican mountains. “I have long thought that the Californian wintering monarchs may be an epiphenomenon—a more or less ephemeral state, subject to radical fluctuations, perhaps even extinction and recolonization,” Pyle wrote in an e-mail. It wasn’t until 1816 that the existence of monarchs in California entered the written record, when they were observed by Russian naturalists on an expedition to circumnavigate the globe. Earlier accounts of the region, dating back to the seventeenth century, by Native Americans, early explorers, and priests sent by the Catholic Church to establish missions, make no mention of the butterflies, leading Pyle to suggest that the western migration “might not even be that old.” \n\n“Lincoln Brower and I have hypothesized that it may have blinked on and off in the past, having been refreshed by chance incursions of Mexican monarchs pushed westerly in the spring by shifting winds,” Pyle wrote. Between 1990 and 1997, he added, the population of California monarchs crashed nearly as severely as it did in 2018, and then recovered. “So, while I cannot say whether the current crash is systemic and lethal or stochastic and recoverable, I suspect the latter,” he said, “And I am very hopeful that the higher numbers in Mexico this winter might be propitiously poised to aid in Californian recovery next spring. It all depends on which way the wind blows.” \n\nThe wind was not blowing at all inside the Lincoln Bedroom as the caterpillar chewed through milkweed leaves and grew proportionately. Outside, in the yard, the butterflies and caterpillars continued to multiply, though predators were quick to find the larvae, and the mortality rate, by my informal daily observations, was high. Then, about two weeks after emerging from his egg, Lincoln climbed to the top of the enclosure, secreted a white gooey liquid, attached himself to it, and then hung like a solitary letter “J.” Days later, he appeared to turn himself inside out and then disappeared into a green, gold-flecked chrysalis. He was gone, though it was not clear where, exactly, he’d gone to.\n\nAnd then I waited, checking the chrysalis obsessively, even though I knew it would be at least a week before a butterfly emerged. Ten days later, I awoke to find the chrysalis transparent, and the black and orange of the monarch’s wings visible through it. Rebirth was imminent, or so I thought. More waiting, more watching, some worrying—I’d had monarchs die before, hanging stillborn in their cradles. But, on the fourteenth day, I witnessed Lincoln break through what now appeared to be the thinnest of membranes, clinging to it for quite a while, his wings still soft and folded. And then, as if someone were pumping them up, they unfurled and began to take shape.  As they did, I noticed from the absence of pheromone patches, that Lincoln was a she, not a he.\n\nI asked Oberhauser, who has devoted most of her professional life to monarch butterflies, why anyone should care if the monarch population crashes, in Mexico or out West. “We can look at a species and say it’s important because it’s a pollinator or it’s a keystone species, and if we pull it out of an ecosystem it’s going to have all these harmful, cascading effects,” she said. “Monarchs probably don’t have big-picture ecosystem importance. But just the fact that they connect people to nature is reason enough to make us care.” At one point, she told me, “When we lose these strong connections with nature, from the point of view of conservation, we lose one of our most important strengths. When people stop caring, things are going to get worse a lot faster.”\n\nOnce Lincoln’s wings hardened, I carried her and her bedroom outdoors, opened the enclosure, and got ready for her to fly away. She didn’t. We sat peaceably for a couple of hours, both of us basking in the sun. She would flap her wings a few times and then stop, like a car engine that could not quite turn over. And then it did, and she took flight, landing on the branch of a nearby tree. Minutes later, she soared above the house and disappeared.\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1f53ee7fe02cbd1635b5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Monarch Butterflies","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"monarch-butterflies"},{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate Change","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"climate-change"},{"id":"5c2e1efd22d4972cd5b834c1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Migration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"migration"}],"sections":[{"id":"596e656cd1f51261132e868e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elements","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elements"}]},"channel":"Science","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a5ac2e2e17730741c5fa","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sue Halpern, a contributing writer covering politics and technology, has been writing for *The New Yorker* since 2005.

Six minutes later, dozens of people were dead or wounded. We know far too much about what happened in between, because the shooter streamed it all to Facebook Live. A post on a far-right Internet forum hosted by the Web site 8chan directed users to the stream; quickly, video of the shooting spread across YouTube and Instagram. A manifesto was shared on Twitter, filled with references to Donald Trump, right-wing American punditry, and white-supremacist memes.\n\nI spoke with Sarah T. Roberts, a professor of information studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, who, over the past eight years, has become an authority on the content-moderation strategies employed by tech companies. (Her book “[Behind the Screen: Content Moderation in the Shadows of Social Media](https://www.amazon.com/Behind-Screen-Content-Moderation-Shadows/dp/0300235887)” will be published by Yale University Press, in June.) In recent years, Roberts has watched with incredulity as companies such as Twitter and Facebook encouraged users to begin streaming live video. “There are not enough moderators in the world to monitor every live stream,” she said. Social-media platforms were already struggling to moderate content posted in the usual way; live-streamed video, which can attract large audiences almost instantly, is even more challenging. \n\nIn theory, Roberts told me, machine-learning systems might one day identify violent and hateful streams as they unfold in real time, although she questions whether we actually want even the most sophisticated algorithms determining what should or shouldn’t make its way onto a platform. In practice, there are few effective systems in place. “By and large, live streaming came online with none of that stuff sorted out,” she said. “There was no real plan for, ‘What are we going to do when people start using it in the worst possible way?’&nbsp;” As live-streaming tools proliferated, some people in the industry worried that it might be “ungovernable.” But the social-media industry was embroiled in what Roberts calls a “functionality arms race.” Twitter acquired the live-streaming app Periscope in 2015; Facebook launched Facebook Live the next year. \n\nThere are options for slowing the torrent of live-streamed videos in general. Platforms could make access to the technology a privilege for trusted users, for example. But such measures would also impede the streaming of video that’s regarded as socially useful—broadcasts from political protests, say, or of police violence. For a time, Facebook Live was widely seen as a useful conduit for positive social change. In the end, it may be impossible to separate the good from the bad.\n\nSocial-media platforms were eager to embrace live streaming because it promised growth. Now scale has become a burden. “Mainstream platforms are putting resources into moderation, but it’s a bit like closing the barn door after the horses have gotten out,” Roberts said. The problem isn’t just new content; once a video is streamed, it spreads, often to sites that have no interest in policing what they host or that lack the resources to moderate. “It will take a while to undo the years of allowing these materials to proliferate and have a foothold on all of these platforms.” \n\nAnd moderators at any one company must reckon with the fact that, ultimately, social-media platforms form a collective ecosystem, ranging from the mainstream to the fringe—from Facebook to 8chan. “People don’t use social-media sites in isolation,” Roberts said. Part of the challenge of moderation is that users may act differently in different spaces, appearing anodyne in one and toxic in another. The shooter in Christchurch, Roberts told me, seems to have been moving “not only among the mainstream platforms but also among different kinds of ideological registers online. He probably cut his teeth on the mainstream platforms. Then, at some point, he became engaged in these spaces where radical incitement to violence and hate speech were the bread and butter. And then, in order to have—I’m sickened to even talk like this—the greatest impact with his behavior, he went back to the mainstream to showcase it.” At one point in his stream, the shooter called out, “Subscribe to PewDiePie!”—a nod to a YouTube channel with eighty-nine million followers, run by the [divisive Internet personality](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/technology/pewdiepie-new-zealand-shooting.html) Felix Kjellberg. This seems less like an earnest endorsement and more like an attempt to merge the mainstream of social media with the fringe. (“I feel absolutely sickened having my named uttered by this person,” Kjellberg tweeted, after the attack.) \n\nThe industry-wide, cross-platform scale of the content-moderation problem is becoming increasingly hard to ignore. “I cannot believe that anyone in these companies feels anything but sick about this,” Roberts said. Lately, she has noticed a shift in the way the industry talks about itself. “For years, it was, ‘Our tools are neutral,’&nbsp;” she said. “Now they might say, ‘Our tools are a mirror, and they reflect society as it is.’&nbsp;” Increasingly, those who work in social media are shifting even further. “The mirror analogy isn’t sufficient, because of the vast power of these platforms to normalize, reify, amplify, and disseminate this material,” Roberts said.

It was a poisonously global moment: the attacker broadcast the massacre live on Facebook, and he posted a so-called manifesto to Twitter, regurgitating neo-Nazi in-jokes and immigration-conspiracy theories about “birth rates” and “white genocide.” His particulars merit little more attention than that.\n\nBy now, we know to restrain our instinct to recirculate, and perversely glamourize, the details. We know to deprive the virulent corners of modern life of the “oxygen of amplification,” in the words of Whitney Phillips, of the Data & Society Research Institute, who is the author of a [valuable report](https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3-PART-3_Oxygen_of_Amplification_DS.pdf ) on the interplay between extremists, technology, and journalism. In a list of best practices, Phillips reminds reporters to treat violent language and memes as “inherently contagious” and to avoid highlighting “objectively false” ideas unless they are prominently undermined. \n\nIt is good advice, but it can also be misused. As news spread of the gunman’s motives, Donald Trump, Jr., who is not known for his powers of restraint, expressed a sudden desire not to give the “NZ shooter what he wants.” He [tweeted](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1106406797051600897), “Don’t speak his name don’t show the footage. Seems that most agree on that. The questions is can the media do what’s right and pass up the ratings they’ll get by doing the opposite? I fear we all know the answer unfortunately.” \n\nDon, Jr.,’s newfound sympathy for decorum most likely owes less to a nuanced theory of violence and publicity than to the shameful reality that the New Zealand killer hailed his father,  President Donald Trump, as “a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose.” In the Oval Office, a few hours later, the President was asked if he considers white nationalism a rising threat. “I don’t, really,” he said. “I think it’s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.” Trump called the incident “a terrible thing.” He was speaking, not incidentally, during a ceremony in which he vetoed an attempt to block his use of emergency funds to build a border wall. He complained, as ever, about an “invasion” of illegal immigrants.\n\nThe New Zealand killer takes his place in the cracked pantheon of violent, Trump-admiring extremists: beside the gunman at the Tree of Life synagogue, in Pittsburgh, who blamed Jews for resettling refugees and immigrants, whom Trump vilifies as the center of his politics; beside the van-dweller in Miami who found purpose amid the throngs of Trump rallies and set about sending pipe bombs to George Soros, journalists, and Democrats. The New Zealand killer did not exact his violence in America, but [he would be at home in our statistics](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-right-wing-terrorism-and-the-enemy-within/): in the past decade, seventy-three per cent of all American extremist-related killings have come from the right wing, compared to twenty-three per cent from Salafi jihadism and three per cent from the left wing, according to the Soufan Center, which studies global security. \n\nPointing out those patterns does not feed oxygen to the sources; it subjects them to the disinfecting power of sunlight. We can only have an honest analysis of the sources of this violence if we understand how it grows and spreads. That applies not only to the role of journalism but also to the role of technology. Whenever a killer relies, as he did in this case, on the Internet to amplify the effects of his terror, some inevitably defend social media as no better and no worse than the humanity that uses it. Don’t blame the hammer, we are told; blame the hand. At best, that is a deflection. One does not have to be a Luddite to believe that the worst of social media is not a mirror image of us; it is a grotesque distortion, a funhouse mirror that bulges and squeezes and disfigures us in ways that mock our humanity instead of reinforcing it.\n\nOnce again, Facebook finds itself scrambling to explain how it will prevent its creations from being used for harm. When I interviewed a range of Facebook executives last year, several of them touted the use of artificial intelligence and human moderators to prevent the misuse of Facebook Live. Alex Schultz, a longtime Facebook staffer, told me that, to detect instances of suicide or murder on Facebook Live, the company created a system that looks for sudden spikes in attention—“by number of people viewing, by the rate at which those impressions are going up, by the percentage of sad reactions versus likes, by the number of people saying, ‘Oh, my God’ down in the comments.” He said, “Then you need artificial intelligence to be able to read those comments, to get the signal out so you can rank it.” In this case, the rampage was broadcast by a head-mounted camera for a hideous seventeen minutes. It stopped only after Facebook was alerted by New Zealand police. In a statement, Mia Garlick, of Facebook New Zealand, said, “Our hearts go out to the victims, their families and the community affected by this horrendous act. New Zealand Police alerted us to a video on Facebook shortly after the livestream commenced and we quickly removed both the shooter’s Facebook and Instagram accounts and the video.”\n\nBy then, archives of the video were everywhere. Carole Cadwalladr, an investigative reporter at the *Observer*, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/carolecadwalla/status/1106533948530876416), “I may have reached my moment of total despair. The full video is all over YouTube. All over Facebook.” She pointed to a version that had been watched twenty-three thousand times on Facebook in one hour. “And 1000s out there,” she wrote.\n\nFor Facebook, the New Zealand massacre is [a gruesome measure](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/eve7w7/documents-show-how-facebook-moderates-terrorism-on-livestreams) of the social-media platform’s power and its limitations. The attack struck just as the company is attempting to refashion itself to focus on small-scale, encrypted conversations. But that new focus will expand alongside the main news feed of public conversation; it will not replace the public forum. And so the peril remains. The company did not create the root cause—what the scholar Thomas Rid [calls](https://twitter.com/RidT/status/1106562419483119616) a “violent transnational neo-fascist ideology”—but the technology has multiplied its force to a degree that is almost beyond measure.\n\nTo allow the killer to monopolize the final image of this moment would be a mistake. Instead, it is worth pausing to absorb the words and deeds of another person whose image raced around the world on social media in the hours after the New Zealand attack: Jill Keats, who is sixty-six, was driving to the mall when she heard what she thought were firecrackers. Then, people started collapsing. “One fell just to the left of my car and one fell to the right,” she [told a reporter](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2019/03/the-poor-guy-passed-away-witness-describes-distressing-chaos-of-christchurch-shooting-scene.html). \n\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n\nKeats, who has a silver ponytail and was wearing a gray cardigan, ducked to avoid gunfire. Then she loaded a wounded man into her car to protect him, and, with the help of another bystander, she compressed his wounds to stanch the bleeding. \n\n“He was trying to ring his wife, and I managed to get it and I answered the phone and I said to her, ‘Your husband’s been shot outside the mosque.’ I said, and ‘Don’t come here to Dean’s Ave, you won’t get through—but please go to a hospital and wait for him,’&nbsp;” Keats said. “Then I kept talking to him and telling him she was at the hospital waiting and he wasn’t to give up. Here we just kept pressure on him and did the best we could for him until we could get him some help.”\n\nHer voice cracking, she went on, “In the meantime, the poor guy across the road passed away.” She paused. “I never thought in my life I would live to see something like this. Not in New Zealand.”\n\nThe reporter tried to console her. “We really commend you for what you did. You’re really a hero.”\n\n“No, I’m not,” Keats said. “No, you just do what you do at the time. I wish I could’ve done more.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cba81ab3335f580f1bb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mass Shootings","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mass-shootings"},{"id":"5c2e1cb6ee7fe02cbd163387","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"New Zealand","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"new-zealand"},{"id":"5c2e1d2e22d4972cd5b8331d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Muslims (Islam)","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"muslims-islam"},{"id":"5c2e1ccc81ab3335f580f1cd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hate Crimes","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hate-crimes"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a02cf1c7a8e33fb390be6","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Evan Osnos joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2008 and covers politics and foreign affairs.

He does not enjoy interviews, especially after two years of ceaseless controversy. Having got his start as a programmer with a nocturnal bent, he is also not a morning person. Walking toward the kitchen, which has a long farmhouse table and cabinets painted forest green, he said, “I haven’t eaten breakfast yet. Have you?”\n\nSince 2011, Zuckerberg has lived in a century-old white clapboard Craftsman in the Crescent Park neighborhood, an enclave of giant oaks and historic homes not far from Stanford University. The house, which cost seven million dollars, affords him a sense of sanctuary. It’s set back from the road, shielded by hedges, a wall, and mature trees. Guests enter through an arched wooden gate and follow a long gravel path to a front lawn with a saltwater pool in the center. The year after Zuckerberg bought the house, he and his longtime girlfriend, Priscilla Chan, held their wedding in the back yard, which encompasses gardens, a pond, and a shaded pavilion. Since then, they have had two children, and acquired a seven-hundred-acre estate in Hawaii, a ski retreat in Montana, and a four-story town house on Liberty Hill, in San Francisco. But the family’s full-time residence is here, a ten-minute drive from Facebook’s headquarters.\n\nOccasionally, Zuckerberg records a Facebook video from the back yard or the dinner table, as is expected of a man who built his fortune exhorting employees to keep “pushing the world in the direction of making it a more open and transparent place.” But his appetite for personal openness is limited. Although Zuckerberg is the most famous entrepreneur of his generation, he remains elusive to everyone but a small circle of family and friends, and his efforts to protect his privacy inevitably attract attention. The local press has chronicled his feud with a developer who announced plans to build a mansion that would look into Zuckerberg’s master bedroom. After a legal fight, the developer gave up, and Zuckerberg spent forty-four million dollars to buy the houses surrounding his. Over the years, he has come to believe that he will always be the subject of criticism. “We’re not—pick your noncontroversial business—selling dog food, although I think that people who do that probably say there is controversy in that, too, but this is an inherently cultural thing,” he told me, of his business. “It’s at the intersection of technology and psychology, and it’s very personal.”\n\nHe carried a plate of banana bread and a carafe of water into the living room, and settled onto a navy-blue velvet sofa. Since co-founding Facebook, in 2004, his uniform has evolved from hoodies and flip-flops to his current outfit, a gray sweater, indigo jeans, and black Nikes. At thirty-four, Zuckerberg, who has very fair skin, a tall forehead, and large eyes, is leaner than when he first became a public figure, more than a decade ago. On the porch, next to the front door, he keeps a Peloton stationary bike, a favorite accessory in the tech world, which live-streams a personal trainer to your home. Zuckerberg uses the machine, but he does not love cycling. A few years ago, on his first attempt to use a road bike with racing pedals, he forgot to unclip, tipped over, and broke his arm. Except for cycling on his porch, he said, “I haven’t clipped in since.”\n\nHe and his wife prefer board games to television, and, within reach of the couch, I noticed a game called Ricochet Robots. “It gets extremely competitive,” Zuckerberg said. “We play with these friends, and one of them is a genius at this. Playing with him is just infuriating.” Dave Morin, a former Facebook employee who is the founder and C.E.O. of Sunrise Bio, a startup seeking cures for depression, used to play Risk with Zuckerberg at the office. “He’s not playing you in a game of Risk. He’s playing you in a game of games,” Morin told me. “The first game, he might amass all his armies on one property, and the next game he might spread them all over the place. He’s trying to figure out the psychological way to beat you in all the games.”\n\nAcross the tech industry, the depth of Zuckerberg’s desire to win is often remarked upon. Dick Costolo, the former C.E.O. of [Twitter](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Twitter), told me, “He’s a ruthless execution machine, and if he has decided to come after you, you’re going to take a beating.” Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, said, “There are a number of people in the Valley who have a perception of Mark that he’s really aggressive and competitive. I think some people are a little hesitant about him from that perspective.” Hoffman has been an investor in Facebook since its early days, but for a long time he sensed that Zuckerberg kept his distance because they were both building social networks. “For many years, it was, like, ‘Your LinkedIn thing is going to be crushed, so even though we’re friendly, I don’t want to get too close to you personally, because I’m going to crush you.’ Now, of course, that’s behind us and we’re good friends.”\n\nWhen I asked Zuckerberg about this reputation, he framed the dynamic differently. The survival of any social-media business rests on “network effects,” in which the value of the network grows only by finding new users. As a result, he said, “there’s a natural zero-sumness. If we’re going to achieve what we want to, it’s not just about building the best features. It’s about building the best community.” He added, “I care about succeeding. And, yes, sometimes you have to beat someone to something, in order to get to the next thing. But that’s not primarily the way that I think I roll.”\n\nFor many years, Zuckerberg ended Facebook meetings with the half-joking exhortation “Domination!” Although he eventually stopped doing this (in European legal systems, “dominance” refers to corporate monopoly), his discomfort with losing is undimmed. A few years ago, he played Scrabble on a corporate jet with a friend’s daughter, who was in high school at the time. She won. Before they played a second game, he wrote a simple computer program that would look up his letters in the dictionary so that he could choose from all possible words. Zuckerberg’s program had a narrow lead when the flight landed. The girl told me, “During the game in which I was playing the program, everyone around us was taking sides: Team Human and Team Machine.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIf Facebook were a country, it would have the largest population on earth. More than 2.2 billion people, about a third of humanity, log in at least once a month. That user base has no precedent in the history of American enterprise. Fourteen years after it was founded, in Zuckerberg’s dorm room, Facebook has as many adherents as Christianity.\n\nA couple of years ago, the company was still revelling in its power. By collecting vast quantities of information about its users, it allows advertisers to target people with precision—a business model that earns Facebook more ad revenue in a year than all American newspapers combined. Zuckerberg was spending much of his time conferring with heads of state and unveiling plans of fantastical ambition, such as building giant drones that would beam free Internet (including Facebook) into developing countries. He enjoyed extraordinary control over his company; in addition to his positions as chairman and C.E.O., he controlled about sixty per cent of shareholder votes, thanks to a special class of stock with ten times the power of ordinary shares. His personal fortune had grown to more than sixty billion dollars. Facebook was one of four companies (along with Google, Amazon, and Apple) that dominated the Internet; the combined value of their stock is larger than the G.D.P. of France.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cfdbd07a5060baeb7b]||||||\n+++\n\nFor years, Facebook had heard concerns about its use of private data and its ability to shape people’s behavior. The company’s troubles came to a head during the Presidential election of 2016, when propagandists used the site to spread misinformation that helped turn society against itself. Some of the culprits were profiteers who gamed Facebook’s automated systems with toxic political clickbait known as “fake news.” In a prime example, at least a hundred Web sites were traced to Veles, Macedonia, a small city where entrepreneurs, some still in high school, discovered that posting fabrications to pro-[Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) Facebook groups unleashed geysers of traffic. Fake-news sources also paid Facebook to “microtarget” ads at users who had proved susceptible in the past.\n\nThe other culprits, according to U.S. intelligence, were Russian agents who wanted to sow political chaos and help Trump win. In February, [Robert Mueller](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mueller), the special counsel investigating Russia’s role in the election, charged thirteen Russians with an “interference operation” that made use of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The Internet Research Agency, a firm in St. Petersburg working for the Kremlin, drew hundreds of thousands of users to Facebook groups optimized to stoke outrage, including Secured Borders, Blacktivist, and Defend the 2nd. They used Facebook to organize offline rallies, and bought Facebook ads intended to hurt Hillary Clinton’s standing among Democratic voters. (One read “Hillary Clinton Doesn’t Deserve the Black Vote.”) With fewer than a hundred operatives, the I.R.A. achieved an astonishing impact: Facebook estimates that the content reached as many as a hundred and fifty million users.\n\nAt the same time, former Facebook executives, echoing a growing body of research, began to voice misgivings about the company’s role in exacerbating isolation, outrage, and addictive behaviors. One of the largest studies, published last year in the _American Journal of Epidemiology_, followed the Facebook use of more than five thousand people over three years and found that higher use correlated with self-reported declines in physical health, mental health, and life satisfaction. At an event in November, 2017, Sean Parker, Facebook’s first president, called himself a “conscientious objector” to social media, saying, “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.” A few days later, Chamath Palihapitiya, the former vice-president of user growth, told an audience at Stanford, “The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works—no civil discourse, no coöperation, misinformation, mistruth.” Palihapitiya, a prominent [Silicon Valley](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Silicon-Valley) figure who worked at Facebook from 2007 to 2011, said, “I feel tremendous guilt. I think we all knew in the back of our minds.” Of his children, he added, “They’re not allowed to use this shit.” (Facebook replied to the remarks in a statement, noting that Palihapitiya had left six years earlier, and adding, “Facebook was a very different company back then.”)\n\nIn March, Facebook was confronted with an even larger scandal: the _Times_ and the British newspaper the _Observer_ reported that a researcher had gained access to the personal information of Facebook users and sold it to [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Cambridge-Analytica), a consultancy hired by Trump and other Republicans which advertised using “psychographic” techniques to manipulate voter behavior. In all, the personal data of eighty-seven million people had been harvested. Moreover, Facebook had known of the problem since December of 2015 but had said nothing to users or regulators. The company acknowledged the breach only after the press discovered it.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica revelations touched off the most serious crisis in Facebook’s history, and, with it, a public reckoning with the power of Big Tech. Facebook is now under investigation by the F.B.I., the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as by authorities abroad, from London to Brussels to Sydney. Facebook’s peers and rivals have expressed conspicuously little sympathy. [Elon Musk](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Elon-Musk) deleted his Facebook pages and those of his companies, Tesla and SpaceX. [Tim Cook](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Tim-Cook), the C.E.O. of Apple, told an interviewer, “We could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer,” but “we’ve elected not to do that.” At Facebook’s annual shareholder meeting, in May, executives struggled to keep order. An investor who interrupted the agenda to argue against Zuckerberg’s renomination as chairman was removed. Outside, an airplane flew a banner that read “*YOU BROKE DEMOCRACY.*{: .small}” It was paid for by Freedom from Facebook, a coalition of progressive groups that have asked the F.T.C. to break up the company into smaller units.\n\nOn July 25th, Facebook’s stock price dropped nineteen per cent, cutting its market value by a hundred and nineteen billion dollars, the largest one-day drop in Wall Street history. Nick Bilton, a technology writer at _Vanity Fair_, tweeted that Zuckerberg was losing $2.7 million per second, “double what the average American makes in an entire lifetime.” Facebook’s user base had flatlined in the U.S. and Canada, and dropped slightly in Europe, and executives warned that revenue growth would decline further, in part because the scandals had led users to opt out of allowing Facebook to collect some data. Facebook depends on trust, and the events of the past two years had made people wonder whether the company deserved it.\n\nZuckerberg’s friends describe his travails as a by-product of his success. He is often compared to another Harvard dropout, [Bill Gates](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Bill-Gates), who has been his mentor in business and philanthropy. Gates told me, “Somebody who is smart, and rich, and ends up not acknowledging problems as quickly as they should will be attacked as arrogant. That comes with the territory.” He added, “I wouldn’t say that Mark’s an arrogant individual.” But, to critics, Facebook is guilty of a willful blindness driven by greed, naïveté, and contempt for oversight.\n\nIn a series of conversations over the summer, I talked to Zuckerberg about Facebook’s problems, and about his underlying views on technology and society. We spoke at his home, at his office, and by phone. I also interviewed four dozen people inside and outside the company about its culture, his performance, and his decision-making. I found Zuckerberg straining, not always coherently, to grasp problems for which he was plainly unprepared. These are not technical puzzles to be cracked in the middle of the night but some of the subtlest aspects of human affairs, including the meaning of truth, the limits of free speech, and the origins of violence.\n\nZuckerberg is now at the center of a full-fledged debate about the moral character of Silicon Valley and the conscience of its leaders. Leslie Berlin, a historian of technology at Stanford, told me, “For a long time, Silicon Valley enjoyed an unencumbered embrace in America. And now everyone says, Is this a trick? And the question Mark Zuckerberg is dealing with is: Should my company be the arbiter of truth and decency for two billion people? Nobody in the history of technology has dealt with that.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nFacebook’s headquarters, at 1 Hacker Way, in Menlo Park, overlooking the salt marshes south of San Francisco, has the feel of a small, prosperous dictatorship, akin to Kuwait or Brunei. The campus is a self-contained universe, with the full range of free Silicon Valley perks: dry cleaning, haircuts, music lessons, and food by the acre, including barbecue, biryani, and salad bars. (New arrivals are said to put on the “Facebook fifteen.”) Along with stock options and generous benefits, such trappings have roots in the nineteen-seventies, when, Leslie Berlin said, founders aspired to create pleasant workplaces and stave off the rise of labor unions. The campus, which was designed with the help of consultants from Disney, is arranged as an ersatz town that encircles a central plaza, with shops and restaurants and offices along a main street. From the air, the word “*Hack*{: .small}” is visible in gigantic letters on the plaza pavement.\n\nOn Zuckerberg’s campus, he is king. Executives offer fulsome praise. David Marcus, who runs Facebook’s blockchain project, told me recently, “When I see him portrayed in certain ways, it really hurts me personally, because it’s not the guy he is.” Even when colleagues speak more candidly, on the whole they like him. “He’s not an asshole,” a former senior executive told me. “That’s why people work there so long.”\n\nBefore I visited Zuckerberg for the first time, in June, members of his staff offered the kind of advice usually reserved for approaching a skittish bird: proceed gingerly, build a connection, avoid surprises. The advice, I discovered, wasn’t necessary. In person, he is warmer and more direct than his public pronouncements, which resemble a politician’s bland pablum, would suggest. The contrast between the public and the private Zuckerberg reminded me of Hillary Clinton. In both cases, friends complain that the popular image is divorced from the casual, funny, generous person they know. Yet neither Zuckerberg nor Clinton has found a way to publicly express a more genuine persona. In Zuckerberg’s case, moments of self-reflection are so rare that, last spring, following a CNN interview in which he said that he wanted to build a company that “my girls are going to grow up and be proud of me for,” the network framed the clip as a news event, with the title “Zuckerberg in rare emotional moment.”\n\nI asked Zuckerberg about his aversion to opening up.“I’m not the most polished person, and I will say something wrong, and you see the cost of that,” he said. “I don’t want to inflict that pain, or do something that’s going to not reflect well on the people around me.” In the most recent flap, a few weeks earlier, he had told Kara Swisher, the host of the “[Recode Decode](https://www.recode.net/2018/7/18/17575158/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-full-transcript-kara-swisher)” podcast, that he permits Holocaust deniers on Facebook because he isn’t sure if they are “intentionally getting it wrong.” After a furor erupted, he issued a statement saying that he finds Holocaust denial “deeply offensive.” Zuckerberg told me, “In an alternate world where there weren’t the compounding experiences that I had, I probably would have gotten more comfortable being more personal, and out there, and I wouldn’t have felt pushback every time I did something. And maybe my persona, or at least how I felt comfortable acting publicly, would shift.”\n\nThe downside of Zuckerberg’s exalted status within his company is that it is difficult for him to get genuine, unexpurgated feedback. He has tried, at times, to puncture his own bubble. In 2013, as a New Year’s resolution, he pledged to meet someone new, outside Facebook, every day. In 2017, he travelled to more than thirty states on a “listening tour” that he hoped would better acquaint him with the outside world. David Plouffe, President Obama’s former campaign manager, who is now the head of policy and advocacy at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the family’s philanthropic investment company, attended some events on the tour. He told me, “When a politician goes to one of those, it’s an hour, and they’re talking for fifty of those minutes. He would talk for, like, five, and just ask questions.”\n\nBut the exercise came off as stilted and tone-deaf. Zuckerberg travelled with a professional photographer, who documented him feeding a calf in Wisconsin, ordering barbecue, and working on an assembly line at a Ford plant in Michigan. Online, people joked that the photos made him look like an extraterrestrial exploring the human race for the first time. A former Facebook executive who was involved in the tour told a friend, “No one wanted to tell Mark, and no one did tell Mark, that this really looks just dumb.”\n\nZuckerberg has spent nearly half his life inside a company of his own making, handpicking his lieutenants, and sculpting his environment to suit him. Even Facebook’s signature royal blue reflects his tastes. He is red-green color-blind, and he chose blue because he sees it most vividly. [Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Sheryl-Sandberg), the chief operating officer, told me, “Sometimes Mark will say, in front of the company, ‘Well, I’ve never worked anywhere else, but Sheryl tells me .&#160;.&#160;.’&#160;” She went on, “He acknowledges he doesn’t always have the most experience. He’s only had the experience he’s had, and being Mark Zuckerberg is pretty extraordinary.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nLong before it seemed inevitable or even plausible, Mark Elliot Zuckerberg had an outsized sense of his own potential. It was “a teleological frame of feeling almost chosen,” a longtime friend told me. “I think Mark has always seen himself as a man of history, someone who is destined to be great, and I mean that in the broadest sense of the term.” Zuckerberg has observed that more than a few giants of history grew up in bourgeois comfort near big cities and then channelled those advantages into transformative power.\n\nIn Zuckerberg’s case, the setting was Dobbs Ferry, New York, a Westchester County suburb twenty-five miles north of New York City. His mother, Karen Kempner, grew up in Queens; on a blind date, she met a mailman’s son, Edward Zuckerberg, of Flatbush, who was studying to be a dentist. They married and had four children. Mark, the only boy, was the second-oldest. His mother, who had become a psychiatrist, eventually gave up her career to take care of the kids and manage the dental office, which was connected to the family home. Of his father, Zuckerberg told me, “He was a dentist, but he was also a huge techie. So he always had not just a system for drilling teeth but, like, the laser system for drilling teeth that was controlled by the computer.” Ed Zuckerberg marketed himself as the Painless Dr. Z, and later drummed up dentistry business with a direct-mail solicitation that declared, “I am literally the Father of Facebook!” (Since 2013, Zuckerberg’s parents have lived in California, where Ed practices part time and lectures on using social media to attract patients.)\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cf2c0c1035aeefc65e]||||||\n+++\n\nIn the nineteen-eighties and nineties, Ed bought early personal computers—the Atari 800, the I.B.M. XT—and Mark learned to code. At twelve, he set up his first network, ZuckNet, on which messages and files could be shared between the house and his father’s dental office. Rabbi David Holtz, of Temple Beth Abraham, in Tarrytown, told me that he watched Zuckerberg with other kids and sensed that he was “beyond a lot of his peers. He was thinking about things that other people were not.” When I asked Zuckerberg where his drive came from, he traced it to his grandparents, who had immigrated from Europe in the early twentieth century. “They came over, went through the Great Depression, had very hard lives,” he said. “Their dream for their kids was that they would each become doctors, which they did, and my mom just always believed that we should have a bigger impact.” His eldest sister, Randi, an early Facebook spokesperson, has gone on to write books and host a radio show; Donna received her Ph.D. in classics from Princeton and edits an online classics journal; Arielle has worked at Google and as a venture capitalist.\n\nWhen Zuckerberg was a junior in high school, he transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy, where he spent most of his time coding, fencing, and studying Latin. Ancient Rome became a lifelong fascination, first because of the language (“It’s very much like coding or math, and so I appreciated that”) and then because of the history. Zuckerberg told me, “You have all these good and bad and complex figures. I think Augustus is one of the most fascinating. Basically, through a really harsh approach, he established two hundred years of world peace.” For non-classics majors: Augustus Caesar, born in 63 B.C., staked his claim to power at the age of eighteen and turned Rome from a republic into an empire by conquering Egypt, northern Spain, and large parts of central Europe. He also eliminated political opponents, banished his daughter for promiscuity, and was suspected of arranging the execution of his grandson.\n\n“What are the trade-offs in that?” Zuckerberg said, growing animated. “On the one hand, world peace is a long-term goal that people talk about today. Two hundred years feels unattainable.” On the other hand, he said, “that didn’t come for free, and he had to do certain things.” In 2012, Zuckerberg and Chan spent their honeymoon in Rome. He later said, “My wife was making fun of me, saying she thought there were three people on the honeymoon: me, her, and Augustus. All the photos were different sculptures of Augustus.” The couple named their second daughter August.\n\nIn 2002, Zuckerberg went to [Harvard](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/harvard), where he embraced the hacker mystique, which celebrates brilliance in pursuit of disruption. “The ‘fuck you’ to those in power was very strong,” the longtime friend said. In 2004, as a sophomore, he embarked on the project whose origin story is now well known: the founding of Thefacebook.com with four fellow-students (“the” was dropped the following year); the legal battles over ownership, including a suit filed by twin brothers, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, accusing Zuckerberg of stealing their idea; the disclosure of embarrassing messages in which Zuckerberg mocked users for giving him so much data (“they ‘trust me.’ dumb fucks,” he wrote); his regrets about those remarks, and his efforts, in the years afterward, to convince the world that he has left that mind-set behind.\n\nDuring Zuckerberg’s sophomore year, in line for the bathroom at a party, he met Priscilla Chan, who was a freshman. Her parents, who traced their roots to China, had grown up in Vietnam and arrived in the U.S. as refugees after the war, settling in Quincy, Massachusetts, where they washed dishes in a Chinese restaurant. Priscilla was the eldest of three daughters, and the first member of her family to go to college. “I suddenly go to Harvard, where there’s this world where people had real and meaningful intellectual pursuits,” she said. “Then I met Mark, who so exemplified that.” She was struck by how little Zuckerberg’s background had in common with her own. “Fifty per cent of people go to college from the high school I went to. You could learn how to be a carpenter or a mechanic,” she said. “I was just, like, ‘This person speaks a whole new language and lives in a framework that I’ve never seen before.’&#160;” She added, “Maybe there was some judgment on my part: ‘You don’t understand me because you went to Phillips Exeter,’&#160;” but, she said, “I had to realize early on that I was not going to change who Mark was.” After Harvard, Chan taught in a primary school and eventually became a pediatrician. In 2017, she stopped seeing patients to be the day-to-day head of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. When I asked Chan about how Zuckerberg had responded at home to the criticism of the past two years, she talked to me about _Sitzfleisch_, the German term for sitting and working for long periods of time. “He’d actually sit so long that he froze up his muscles and injured his hip,” she said.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAfter his sophomore year, Zuckerberg moved to Palo Alto and never left. Even by the standards of Silicon Valley, Facebook’s first office had a youthful feel. Zuckerberg carried two sets of business cards. One said “I’m CEO .&#160;.&#160;. bitch!” Visitors encountered a graffiti mural of a scantily clad woman riding a Rottweiler. In Adam Fisher’s “[Valley of Genius](https://www.amazon.com/Valley-Genius-Uncensored-History-Founders/dp/1455559024/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1536591936&sr=8-1&keywords=valley+of+genius+the+uncensored+history+of+silicon+valley),” an oral history of Silicon Valley, an early employee named Ezra Callahan muses, “&#160;‘How much was the direction of the internet influenced by the perspective of nineteen-, twenty-, twenty-one-year-old well-off white boys?’ That’s a real question that sociologists will be studying forever.”\n\nFacebook was fortunate to launch when it did: Silicon Valley was recovering from the dot-com bust and was entering a period of near-messianic ambitions. The Internet was no longer so new that users were scarce, but still new enough that it was largely unregulated; first movers could amass vast followings and consolidate power, and the coming rise of inexpensive smartphones would bring millions of new people online. Most important, Facebook capitalized on a resource that most people hardly knew existed: the willingness of users to subsidize the company by handing over colossal amounts of personal information, for free.\n\nIn Facebook, Zuckerberg had found the instrument to achieve his conception of greatness. His onetime speechwriter Katherine Losse, in her memoir, “[The Boy Kings](https://www.amazon.com/Boy-Kings-Journey-Social-Network/dp/1451668260/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1536591916&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Boy+Kings),” explained that the “engineering ideology of Facebook” was clear: “Scaling and growth are everything, individuals and their experiences are secondary to what is necessary to maximize the system.” Over time, Facebook devoted ever-greater focus to what is known in Silicon Valley as “growth hacking,” the constant pursuit of scale. Whenever the company talked about “connecting people,” that was, in effect, code for user growth.\n\nThen, in 2007, growth plateaued at around fifty million users and wouldn’t budge. Other social networks had maxed out at around that level, and Facebook employees wondered if they had hit a hidden limit. Zuckerberg created a special Growth Team, which had broad latitude to find ways of boosting the numbers. Among other fixes, they discovered that, by offering the site in more languages, they could open huge markets. Alex Schultz, a founding member of the Growth Team, said that he and his colleagues were fanatical in their pursuit of expansion. “You will fight for that inch, you will die for that inch,” he told me. Facebook left no opportunity untapped. In 2011, the company asked the Federal Election Commission for an exemption to rules requiring the source of funding for political ads to be disclosed. In filings, a Facebook lawyer argued that the agency “should not stand in the way of innovation.”\n\nSandy Parakilas, who joined Facebook in 2011, as an operations manager, paraphrased the message of his orientation session as “We believe in the religion of growth.” He said, “The Growth Team was the coolest. Other teams would even try to call subgroups within their teams the ‘Growth X’ or the ‘Growth Y’ to try to get people excited.”\n\nTo gain greater reach, Facebook had made the fateful decision to become a “platform” for outside developers, much as Windows had been in the realm of desktop computers, a generation before. The company had opened its trove of data to programmers who wanted to build Facebook games, personality tests, and other apps. After a few months at Facebook, Parakilas was put in charge of a team responsible for making sure that outsiders were not misusing the data, and he was unnerved by what he found. Some games were siphoning off users’ messages and photographs. In one case, he said, a developer was harvesting user information, including that of children, to create unauthorized profiles on its own Web site. Facebook had given away data before it had a system to check for abuse. Parakilas suggested that there be an audit to uncover the scale of the problem. But, according to Parakilas, an executive rejected the idea, telling him, “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?”\n\nParakilas told me, “It was very difficult to get the kind of resources that you needed to do a good job of insuring real compliance. Meanwhile, you looked at the Growth Team and they had engineers coming out of their ears. All the smartest minds are focussed on doing whatever they can possibly do to get those growth numbers up.”\n\nNew hires learned that a crucial measure of the company’s performance was how many people had logged in to Facebook on six of the previous seven days, a measurement known as L6/7\\. “You could say it’s how many people love this service so much they use it six out of seven days,” Parakilas, who left the company in 2012, said. “But, if your job is to get that number up, at some point you run out of good, purely positive ways. You start thinking about ‘Well, what are the dark patterns that I can use to get people to log back in?’&#160;”\n\nFacebook engineers became a new breed of behaviorists, tweaking levers of vanity and passion and susceptibility. The real-world effects were striking. In 2012, when Chan was in medical school, she and Zuckerberg discussed a critical shortage of organs for transplant, inspiring Zuckerberg to add a small, powerful nudge on Facebook: if people indicated that they were organ donors, it triggered a notification to friends, and, in turn, a cascade of social pressure. Researchers later found that, on the first day the feature appeared, it increased official organ-donor enrollment more than twentyfold nationwide.\n\nSean Parker later described the company’s expertise as “exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.” The goal: “How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?” Facebook engineers discovered that people find it nearly impossible not to log in after receiving an e-mail saying that someone has uploaded a picture of them. Facebook also discovered its power to affect people’s political behavior. Researchers found that, during the 2010 midterm elections, Facebook was able to prod users to vote simply by feeding them pictures of friends who had already voted, and by giving them the option to click on an “I Voted” button. The technique boosted turnout by three hundred and forty thousand people—more than four times the number of votes separating Trump and Clinton in key states in the 2016 race. It became a running joke among employees that Facebook could tilt an election just by choosing where to deploy its “I Voted” button.\n\nThese powers of social engineering could be put to dubious purposes. In 2012, Facebook data scientists used nearly seven hundred thousand people as guinea pigs, feeding them happy or sad posts to test whether emotion is contagious on social media. (They concluded that it is.) When the findings were published, in the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_, they caused an uproar among users, many of whom were horrified that their emotions may have been surreptitiously manipulated. In an apology, one of the scientists wrote, “In hindsight, the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this anxiety.”\n\nFacebook was, in the words of Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google, becoming a pioneer in “persuasive technology.” He explained, “A hammer, in your hand, is non-persuasive—it doesn’t have its own ways of manipulating the person that holds it. But Facebook and Snapchat, in their design features, are persuading a teen-ager to wake up and see photo after photo after photo of their friends having fun without them, even if it makes them feel worse.” In 2015, Harris delivered a talk at Facebook about his concern that social media was contributing to alienation. “I said, ‘You guys are in the best position in the world to deal with loneliness and see it as a thing that you are amplifying and a thing that you can help make go the other way,’&#160;” he told me. “They didn’t do anything about it.” He added, “My points were in their blind spot.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs Facebook grew, Zuckerberg and his executives adopted a core belief: even if people criticized your decisions, they would eventually come around. In one of the first demonstrations of that idea, in 2006, Facebook introduced the News Feed, a feature that suddenly alerted friends whenever a user changed profile pictures, joined groups, or altered a relationship status. (Until then, users had to visit a friend’s page to see updates.) Users revolted. There was a street protest at the headquarters, and hundreds of thousands of people joined a Facebook group opposing the change. Zuckerberg posted a tepid apology (“Calm down. Breathe. We hear you.”), and people got used to the feed.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cf477b8357353ab502]||||||\n+++\n\n“A lot of the early experience for me was just having people really not believe that what we were going to do was going to work,” Zuckerberg told me. “If you think about the early narratives, it was, like, ‘Well, this was just a college thing.’ Or ‘It’s not gonna be a big deal.’ Or ‘O.K., other people are using it, but it’s kind of a fad. There’s Friendster and there’s MySpace, and there will be something after,’ or whatever.” He added, “I feel like it really tests you emotionally to have constant doubt, and the assertion that you don’t know what you are doing.”\n\nIn 2006, Zuckerberg made his most unpopular decision at the fledgling company. Yahoo was offering a billion dollars to buy Facebook and, as Matt Cohler, a top aide at the time, recalls, “Our growth had stalled out.” Cohler and many others implored Zuckerberg to take the offer, but he refused. “I think nearly all of his leadership team lost faith in him and in the business,” Cohler said. Zuckerberg told me that most of his leadership “left within eighteen months. Some of them I had to fire because it was just too dysfunctional. It just completely blew up. But the thing that I learned from that is, if you stick with your values and with what you believe you want to be doing in the world, you can get through. Sometimes it will take some time, and you have to rebuild, but that’s a pretty powerful lesson.”\n\nOn several occasions, Zuckerberg stumbled when it came to issues of privacy. In 2007, Facebook started giving advertisers a chance to buy into a program called Beacon, which would announce to a user’s friends what that user was browsing for, or buying, online. Users could opt out, but many had no idea that the feature existed until it revealed upcoming holiday gifts, or, in some cases, exposed extramarital affairs. Zuckerberg apologized (“We simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize for it,” he wrote), and Beacon was withdrawn.\n\nDespite the apology, Zuckerberg was convinced that he was ahead of his users, not at odds with them. In 2010, he said that privacy was no longer a “social norm.” That year, the company found itself in trouble again after it revised its privacy controls to make most information public by default. The Federal Trade Commission cited Facebook for “engaging in unfair and deceptive practices” with regard to the privacy of user data. The company signed a consent decree pledging to establish a “comprehensive privacy program” and to evaluate it every other year for twenty years. In a post, Zuckerberg offered a qualified apology: “I think that a small number of high profile mistakes .&#160;.&#160;. have often overshadowed much of the good work we’ve done.”\n\nFacebook had adopted a buccaneering motto, “Move fast and break things,” which celebrated the idea that it was better to be flawed and first than careful and perfect. Andrew Bosworth, a former Harvard teaching assistant who is now one of Zuckerberg’s longest-serving lieutenants and a member of his inner circle, explained, “A failure can be a form of success. It’s not the form you want, but it can be a useful thing to how you learn.” In Zuckerberg’s view, skeptics were often just fogies and scolds. “There’s always someone who wants to slow you down,” he said in a commencement address at Harvard last year. “In our society, we often don’t do big things because we’re so afraid of making mistakes that we ignore all the things wrong today if we do nothing. The reality is, anything we do will have issues in the future. But that can’t keep us from starting.”\n\nZuckerberg’s disregard for criticism entered a more emphatic phase in 2010, with the release of the movie “[The Social Network](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/04/influencing-people),” an account of Facebook’s early years, written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher. Some of the film was fictionalized. It presented Zuckerberg’s motivation largely as a desire to meet girls, even though, in real life, he was dating Priscilla Chan for most of the time period covered in the movie. But other elements cut close to the truth, including the depiction of his juvenile bravado and the early feuds over ownership. Zuckerberg and Facebook had chosen not to be involved in the production, and the portrayal was unflattering. Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, is cocksure and cold, and the real Zuckerberg found the depiction hurtful. “First impressions matter a lot, and for a lot of people that was their introduction to me,” he told me. “My reaction to this, to all these things, is primarily that I perceive it through the employees.” His concern was less about how people would think of him, he said, than about “how is our company, how are our employees—these people I work with and care so much about—how are they going to process this?”\n\nBefore the movie came out, Facebook executives debated how to respond. Zuckerberg settled on a stance of effortful good cheer, renting a movie theatre to screen it for the staff. Eight years later, Facebook executives still mention what they call, resentfully, “the movie.” Sandberg, who is the company’s second most important public figure, and one of Zuckerberg’s most ardent defenders, told me, “From its facts to its essence to its portrayal, I think that was a very unfair picture. I still think it forms the basis of a lot of what people believe about Mark.”\n\nWhile the movie contributed to the fortress mentality on campus, Zuckerberg made a series of decisions that solidified his confidence in his instincts. In 2012, he paid a billion dollars for [Instagram](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/instagram), the photo-sharing service, which at the time had only thirteen employees. Outside the industry, the startup appeared wildly overpriced, but it proved to be one of the best investments in the history of the Internet. (Today, Instagram is valued at more than a hundred times what Zuckerberg paid for it, and, even more important, it is popular with young people, a cohort that shows declining interest in Facebook.) That spring, Facebook went public on the Nasdaq, at a valuation of a hundred and four billion dollars. There were technical glitches on the day of the listing, and many people doubted that the company could earn enough money to justify the valuation. The share price promptly sank. The _Wall Street Journal_ called the I.P.O. a “[fiasco](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304821304577436873952633672),” and shareholders sued Facebook and Zuckerberg. “We got a ton of criticism,” he recalled. “Our market cap got cut in half. But what I felt was, we were at a sufficient skill and complexity that it was going to take a couple years to work through the problem, but I had strong conviction that we were doing the right thing.” (Even with its recent plunge, the value of Facebook stock has more than quadrupled in the years since.)\n\nZuckerberg was happy to make sharp turns to achieve his aims. In 2011, when users started moving from desktop computers to phones, Facebook swerved toward mobile technology. Zuckerberg told employees that he would kick them out of his office if their ideas did not account for the transition. “Within a month, you literally can’t meet with Mark if you’re not bringing him a mobile product,” Bosworth recalled.\n\nIn 2014, as problems accumulated, Facebook changed its motto, “Move fast and break things,” to the decidedly less glamorous “Move fast with stable infrastructure.” Still, internally, much of the original spirit endured, and the push for haste began to take a toll in the offline world. In early 2016, Zuckerberg directed employees to accelerate the release of Facebook Live, a video-streaming service, and expanded its team of engineers from twelve to more than a hundred. When the product emerged, two months later, so did unforeseen issues: the service let users flag videos as inappropriate, but it didn’t give them a way to indicate where in a broadcast the problem appeared. As a result, Facebook Live videos of people committing suicide, or engaged in criminal activity, started circulating before reviewers had time to race through, find the issues, and take the videos down. A few months after the service launched, a Chicago man named Antonio Perkins was fatally shot on Facebook Live and the video was viewed hundreds of thousands of times.\n\nThe incident might have served as a warning to slow down, but, instead, the next day, Bosworth sent around a remarkable internal memo justifying some of Facebook’s “ugly” physical and social effects as the trade-offs necessary for growth: “Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is \\*de facto\\* good.”\n\nThis spring, after the memo [leaked to BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data), Bosworth said that he had been playing devil’s advocate, and Zuckerberg issued a statement: “Boz is a talented leader who says many provocative things. This was one that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly. We’ve never believed the ends justify the means.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nZuckerberg was also experimenting with [philanthropy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/27/gospels-of-giving-for-the-new-gilded-age). In 2010, shortly before the release of “The Social Network,” he made a high-profile gift. Appearing onstage at “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” along with Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, and Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, he announced a hundred-million-dollar donation to help Newark’s struggling public-school system. [The project](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/schooled) quickly encountered opposition from local groups that saw it as out of touch, and, eight years later, it’s generally considered a failure. In May, Ras Baraka, Newark’s mayor, said of the donation, “You can’t just cobble up a bunch of money and drop it in the middle of the street and say, ‘This is going to fix everything.’&#160;”\n\nFor all the criticism, the project has produced some measurable improvements. A Harvard study found greater gains in English than the state average, and a study by MarGrady Research, an education-policy group, found that high-school graduation rates and over-all student enrollment in Newark have risen since the donation. Zuckerberg emphasizes those results, even as he acknowledges flaws in his approach. “Your earning potential is dramatically higher if you graduate from high school versus not. That part of it, I think, is the part that worked and it was effective,” he said. “There were a bunch of other things that we tried that either were much harder than we thought or just didn’t work.” Strategies that helped him in business turned out to hurt him in education reform. “I think in a lot of philanthropy and government-related work, if you try five things and a few of them fail, then the ones that fail are going to get a lot of the attention,” he said.\n\nIn 2015, Zuckerberg and Chan pledged to spend ninety-nine per cent of their Facebook fortune “to advance human potential and promote equality for all children in the next generation.” They created the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited-liability company that gives to charity, invests in for-profit companies, and engages in political advocacy. David Plouffe said that the lessons of the Newark investment shaped the initiative’s perspective. “I think the lesson was, you have to do this in full partnership with the community, not just the leaders,” he said. “You need to have enthusiastic buy-in from superintendents, and teachers, and parents.”\n\nIn contrast to a traditional foundation, an L.L.C. can lobby and give money to politicians, without as strict a legal requirement to disclose activities. In other words, rather than trying to win over politicians and citizens in places like Newark, Zuckerberg and Chan could help elect politicians who agree with them, and rally the public directly by running ads and supporting advocacy groups. (A spokesperson for C.Z.I. said that it has given no money to candidates; it has supported ballot initiatives through a 501(c)(4) social-welfare organization.) “The whole point of the L.L.C. structure is to allow a coördinated attack,” Rob Reich, a co-director of Stanford’s Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society, told me. The structure has gained popularity in Silicon Valley but has been criticized for allowing wealthy individuals to orchestrate large-scale social agendas behind closed doors. Reich said, “There should be much greater transparency, so that it’s not dark. That’s not a criticism of Mark Zuckerberg. It’s a criticism of the law.”\n\nIn 2016, Zuckerberg announced, onstage and in a Facebook post, his intention to “help cure all disease in our children’s lifetime.” That was partly bluster: C.Z.I. is working on a slightly more realistic agenda, to “cure, prevent or manage all diseases.” The theatrics irritated some in the philanthropy world who thought that Zuckerberg’s presentation minimized the challenges, but, in general, scientists have applauded the ambition. When I asked Zuckerberg about the reception of the project, he said, “It’s funny, when I talk to people here in the Valley, you get a couple of reactions. A bunch of people have the reaction of ‘Oh, that’s obviously going to happen on its own—why don’t you just spend your time doing something else?’ And then a bunch of people have the reaction of ‘Oh, that seems almost impossible—why are you setting your sights so high?’&#160;”\n\nCharacteristically, Zuckerberg favors the optimistic scenario. “On average, every year for the last eighty years or so, I think, life expectancy has gone up by about a quarter of a year. And, if you believe that technological and scientific progress is not going to slow, there is a potential upside to speeding that up,” he said. “We’re going to get to a point where the life expectancy implied by extrapolating that out will mean that we’ll basically have been able to manage or cure all of the major things that people suffer from and die from today. Based on the data that we already see, it seems like there’s a reasonable shot.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3ce01fe0d4c650956c9]||||||\n+++\n\nI asked Bill Gates, whose private foundation is the largest in the U.S., about Zuckerberg’s objectives. “There are aspirations and then there are plans,” he said. “And plans vary in terms of their degree of realism and concreteness.” He added that Zuckerberg’s long-range goal is “very safe, because you will not be around to write the article saying that he overcommitted.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs Facebook expanded, so did its blind spots. The company’s financial future relies partly on growth in developing countries, but the platform has been a powerful catalyst of violence in fragile parts of the globe. In India, the largest market for Facebook’s WhatsApp service, hoaxes have triggered riots, lynchings, and fatal beatings. Local officials resorted to shutting down the Internet sixty-five times last year. In Libya, people took to Facebook to trade weapons, and armed groups relayed the locations of targets for artillery strikes. In Sri Lanka, after a Buddhist mob attacked Muslims this spring over a false rumor, a Presidential adviser told the _[Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/world/asia/facebook-sri-lanka-riots.html)_, “The germs are ours, but Facebook is the wind.”\n\nNowhere has the damage been starker than in [Myanmar](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Myanmar), where the Rohingya Muslim minority has been subject to brutal killings, gang rapes, and torture. In 2012, around one per cent of the country’s population had access to the Internet. Three years later, that figure had reached twenty-five per cent. Phones often came preloaded with the Facebook app, and Buddhist extremists seeking to inflame ethnic tensions with the Rohingya mastered the art of misinformation. Wirathu, a monk with a large Facebook following, sparked a deadly riot against Muslims in 2014 when he shared a fake report of a rape and warned of a “Jihad against us.” Others gamed Facebook’s rules against hate speech by fanning paranoia about demographic change. Although Muslims make up no more than five per cent of the country, a popular graphic appearing on Facebook cautioned that “when Muslims become the most powerful” they will offer “Islam or the sword.”\n\nBeginning in 2013, a series of experts on Myanmar met with Facebook officials to warn them that it was fuelling attacks on the Rohingya. David Madden, an entrepreneur based in Myanmar, delivered a presentation to officials at the Menlo Park headquarters, pointing out that the company was playing a role akin to that of the radio broadcasts that spread hatred during the Rwandan genocide. In 2016, C4ADS, a Washington-based nonprofit, published a detailed analysis of Facebook usage in Myanmar, and described a “campaign of hate speech that actively dehumanizes Muslims.” Facebook officials said that they were hiring more Burmese-language reviewers to take down dangerous content, but the company repeatedly declined to say how many had actually been hired. By last March, the situation had become dire: almost a million Rohingya had fled the country, and more than a hundred thousand were confined to internal camps. The United Nations investigator in charge of examining the crisis, which the U.N. has deemed a genocide, said, “I’m afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it was originally intended.” Afterward, when pressed, Zuckerberg repeated the claim that Facebook was “hiring dozens” of additional Burmese-language content reviewers.\n\nMore than three months later, I asked Jes Kaliebe Petersen, the C.E.O. of Phandeeyar, a tech hub in Myanmar, if there had been any progress. “We haven’t seen any tangible change from Facebook,” he told me. “We don’t know how much content is being reported. We don’t know how many people at Facebook speak Burmese. The situation is getting worse and worse here.”\n\nI saw Zuckerberg the following morning, and asked him what was taking so long. He replied, “I think, fundamentally, we’ve been slow at the same thing in a number of areas, because it’s actually the same problem. But, yeah, I think the situation in Myanmar is terrible.” It was a frustrating and evasive reply. I asked him to specify the problem. He said, “Across the board, the solution to this is we need to move from what is fundamentally a reactive model to a model where we are using technical systems to flag things to a much larger number of people who speak all the native languages around the world and who can just capture much more of the content.”\n\nI told him that people in Myanmar are incredulous that a company with Facebook’s resources has failed to heed their complaints. “We’re taking this seriously,” he said. “You can’t just snap your fingers and solve these problems. It takes time to hire the people and train them, and to build the systems that can flag stuff for them.” He promised that Facebook would have “a hundred or more Burmese-speaking people by the end of the year,” and added, “I hate that we’re in this position where we are not moving as quickly as we would like.” A few weeks after our conversation, Facebook announced that it was banning Myanmar’s Army chief and several other military officials.\n\nOver the years, Zuckerberg had come to see his ability to reject complaints as a virtue. But, by 2016, that stance had primed the company for a crisis. Tristan Harris, the design ethicist, said, “When you’re running anything like Facebook, you get criticized all the time, and you just stop paying attention to criticism if a lot of it is not well founded. You learn to treat it as naïve and uninformed.” He went on, “The problem is it also puts you out of touch with genuine criticism from people who actually understand the issues.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe 2016 election was supposed to be good for Facebook. That January, Sheryl Sandberg told investors that the election would be “a big deal in terms of ad spend,” comparable to the Super Bowl and the World Cup. According to Borrell Associates, a research and consulting firm, candidates and other political groups were on track to spend $1.4 billion online in the election, up ninefold from four years earlier.\n\nFacebook offered to “embed” employees, for free, in Presidential campaign offices to help them use the platform effectively. Clinton’s campaign said no. Trump’s said yes, and Facebook employees helped his campaign craft messages. Although Trump’s language was openly hostile to ethnic minorities, inside Facebook his behavior felt, to some executives, like just part of the distant cesspool of Washington. Americans always seemed to be choosing between a hated Republican and a hated Democrat, and Trump’s descriptions of Mexicans as rapists was simply an extension of that.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump used Facebook to raise two hundred and eighty million dollars. Just days before the election, his team paid for a voter-suppression effort on the platform. According to _Bloomberg Businessweek_, it targeted three Democratic constituencies—“idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans”—sending them videos precisely tailored to discourage them from turning out for Clinton. Theresa Hong, the Trump campaign’s digital-content director, later told an interviewer, “Without Facebook we wouldn’t have won.”\n\nAfter the election, Facebook executives fretted that the company would be blamed for the spread of fake news. Zuckerberg’s staff gave him statistics showing that the vast majority of election information on the platform was legitimate. At a tech conference a few days later, Zuckerberg was defensive. “The idea that fake news on Facebook—of which, you know, it’s a very small amount of the content—influenced the election in any way, I think, is a pretty crazy idea,” he said. To some at Facebook, Zuckerberg’s defensiveness was alarming. A former executive told [_Wired_,](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-2-years-of-hell/) “We had to really flip him on that. We realized that if we didn’t, the company was going to start heading down this pariah path.”\n\nWhen I asked Zuckerberg about his “pretty crazy” comment, he said that he was wrong to have been “glib.” He told me, “Nobody wants any amount of fake news. It is an issue on an ongoing basis, and we need to take that seriously.” But he still bristles at the implication that Facebook may have distorted voter behavior. “I find the notion that people would only vote some way because they were tricked to be almost viscerally offensive,” he said. “Because it goes against the whole notion that you should trust people and that individuals are smart and can understand their own experience and can make their own assessments about what direction they want their community to go in.”\n\nShortly after the election, Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, contacted Facebook to discuss Russian interference. “The initial reaction was completely dismissive,” he told me. But, by the spring, he sensed that the company was realizing that it had a serious problem. “They were seeing an enormous amount of Russian activity in the French elections,” Warner said. “It was getting better, but I still don’t think they were putting nearly enough resources behind this.” Warner, who made a fortune in the telecom business, added, “Most of the companies in the Valley think that policymakers, one, don’t get it, and, two, that ultimately, if they just stonewall us, then we’ll go away.”\n\nFacebook moved fitfully to acknowledge the role it had played in the election. In September of 2017, after Robert Mueller obtained a search warrant, Facebook agreed to give his office an inventory of ads linked to Russia and the details of who had paid for them. In October, Facebook disclosed that Russian operatives had published about eighty thousand posts, reaching a hundred and twenty-six million Americans.\n\nIn March, after the Cambridge Analytica news broke, Zuckerberg and Facebook were paralyzed. For five days, Zuckerberg said nothing. His personal Facebook profile offered no statements or analysis. Its most recent post was a photo of him and Chan baking hamantaschen for Purim.\n\n“I feel like we’ve let people down and that feels terrible,” he told me later. “But it goes back to this notion that we shouldn’t be making the same mistake multiple times.” He insists that fake news is less common than people imagine: “The average person might perceive, from how much we and others talk about it, that there is more than ten times as much misinformation or hoax content on Facebook than the academic measures that we’ve seen so far suggest.” He is still not convinced that the spread of misinformation had an impact on the election. “I actually don’t consider that a closed thing,” he said. “I still think that’s the kind of thing that needs to be studied.”\n\nIn conversation, Zuckerberg is, unsurprisingly, highly analytical. When he encounters a theory that doesn’t accord with his own, he finds a seam of disagreement—a fact, a methodology, a premise—and hammers at it. It’s an effective technique for winning arguments, but one that makes it difficult to introduce new information. Over time, some former colleagues say, his deputies have begun to filter out bad news from presentations before it reaches him. A former Facebook official told me, “They only want to hear good news. They don’t want people who are disagreeing with them. There is a culture of ‘You go along to get along.’&#160;”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cfbc66792cd5fab4be]||||||\n+++\n\nI once asked Zuckerberg what he reads to get the news. “I probably mostly read aggregators,” he said. “I definitely follow Techmeme”—a roundup of headlines about his industry—“and the media and political equivalents of that, just for awareness.” He went on, “There’s really no newspaper that I pick up and read front to back. Well, that might be true of most people these days—most people don’t read the physical paper—but there aren’t many news Web sites where I go to browse.”\n\nA couple of days later, he called me and asked to revisit the subject. “I felt like my answers were kind of vague, because I didn’t necessarily feel like it was appropriate for me to get into which specific organizations or reporters I read and follow,” he said. “I guess what I tried to convey, although I’m not sure if this came across clearly, is that the job of uncovering new facts and doing it in a trusted way is just an absolutely critical function for society.”\n\nZuckerberg and Sandberg have attributed their mistakes to excessive optimism, a blindness to the darker applications of their service. But that explanation ignores their fixation on growth, and their unwillingness to heed warnings. Zuckerberg resisted calls to reorganize the company around a new understanding of privacy, or to reconsider the depth of data it collects for advertisers.\n\nJames P. Steyer, the founder and C.E.O. of Common Sense Media, an organization that promotes safety in technology and media for children, visited Facebook’s headquarters in the spring of 2018 to discuss his concerns about a product called Messenger Kids, which allows children under thirteen—the minimum age to use the primary Facebook app—to make video calls and send messages to contacts that a parent approves. He met with Sandberg and Elliot Schrage, at the time the head of policy and communications. “I respect their business success, and like Sheryl personally, and I was hoping they might finally consider taking steps to better protect kids. Instead, they said that the best thing for young kids was to spend more time on Messenger Kids,” Steyer told me. “They still seemed to be in denial. Would _you_ ‘move fast and break things’ when it comes to children? To our democracy? No, because you can damage them forever.”\n\nTo some people in the company, the executives seemed concentrated not on solving the problems or on preventing the next ones but on containing the damage. Tavis McGinn, a former Google pollster, started working at Facebook in the spring of 2017, doing polls with a narrow focus: measuring the public perception of Zuckerberg and Sandberg. During the next six months, McGinn conducted eight surveys and four focus groups in three countries, collecting the kinds of measurements favored by politicians and advertisers. Facebook polled reactions to the company’s new stated mission to “bring the world closer together,” as well as to items on Zuckerberg’s social-media feed, including his writings, photographs, and even his casual banter during a back-yard barbecue broadcast on Facebook Live.\n\nIn September, McGinn resigned. In an interview, he told the Web site the Verge that he had become discouraged. “I was not going to be able to change the way that the company does business,” he said. “I couldn’t change the values. I couldn’t change the culture.” He concluded that measuring the “true social outcomes” of Facebook was of limited interest to senior staffers. “I think research can be very powerful, if people are willing to listen,” he said. “But I decided after six months that it was a waste of my time to be there. I didn’t feel great about the product. I didn’t feel proud to tell people I worked at Facebook. I didn’t feel I was helping the world.” (McGinn, who has signed a nondisclosure agreement with Facebook, declined to comment for this article.)\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn March, Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress for the first time about Facebook’s handling of user data. The hearing was scheduled for April. As the date approached, the hearing acquired the overtones of a trial.\n\nIn barely two years, the mood in Washington had shifted. Internet companies and entrepreneurs, formerly valorized as the vanguard of American ingenuity and the astronauts of our time, were being compared to Standard Oil and other monopolists of the Gilded Age. This spring, the _Wall Street Journal_ published [an article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/techs-titans-tiptoe-toward-monopoly-1527783845) that began, “Imagine a not-too-distant future in which trustbusters force Facebook to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp.” It was accompanied by a sepia-toned illustration in which portraits of Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and other tech C.E.O.s had been grafted onto overstuffed torsos meant to evoke the robber barons. In 1915, Louis Brandeis, the reformer and future Supreme Court Justice, testified before a congressional committee about the dangers of corporations large enough that they could achieve a level of near-sovereignty “so powerful that the ordinary social and industrial forces existing are insufficient to cope with it.” He called this the “curse of bigness.” Tim Wu, a Columbia law-school professor and the author of a forthcoming book inspired by Brandeis’s phrase, told me, “Today, no sector exemplifies more clearly the threat of bigness to democracy than Big Tech.” He added, “When a concentrated private power has such control over what we see and hear, it has a power that rivals or exceeds that of elected government.”\n\nShortly before Zuckerberg was due to testify, a team from the Washington law firm of WilmerHale flew to Menlo Park to run him through mock hearings and to coach him on the requisite gestures of humility. Even before the recent scandals, Bill Gates had advised Zuckerberg to be alert to the opinions of lawmakers, a lesson that Gates had learned in 1998, when Microsoft faced accusations of monopolistic behavior. Gates testified to Congress, defiantly, that “the computer-software industry is not broken, and there is no need to fix it.” Within months, the Department of Justice sued Microsoft for violating federal antitrust law, leading to three years of legal agony before a settlement was reached. Gates told me that he regretted “taunting” regulators, saying, “Not something I would choose to repeat.” He encouraged Zuckerberg to be attentive to D.C. “I said, ‘Get an office there—now.’ And Mark did, and he owes me,” Gates said. Last year, Facebook spent $11.5 million on lobbying in Washington, ranking it between the American Bankers Association and General Dynamics among top spenders.\n\nOn April 10th, when Zuckerberg arrived at the [Senate hearing](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/what-was-missing-from-mark-zuckerbergs-first-day-of-congressional-testimony), he wore a sombre blue suit, and took a seat before more than forty senators. In front of him, his notes outlined likely questions and answers, including the prospect that a senator might ask him to step down from the company. His answer, in shorthand, would be: “Founded Facebook. My decisions. I made mistakes. Big challenge, but we’ve solved problems before, going to solve this one. Already taking action.”\n\nAs it turned out, nobody asked him to resign—or much of anything difficult. Despite scattered moments of pressure, the overwhelming impression left by the event was how poorly some senators grasped the issues. In the most revealing moment, Orrin Hatch, the eighty-four-year-old Republican from Utah, demanded to know how Facebook makes money if “users don’t pay for your service.” Zuckerberg replied, “Senator, we run ads,” allowing a small smile.\n\nTo observers inclined to distrust Zuckerberg, he was evasive to the point of amnesiac—he said, more than forty times, that he would need to follow up—but when the hearing concluded, after five hours, he had emerged unscathed, and Wall Street, watching closely, rewarded him by boosting the value of Facebook’s stock by twenty billion dollars. A few days later, on the internal Facebook message board, an employee wrote that he planned to buy T-shirts reading “Senator, we run ads.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWhen I asked Zuckerberg whether policymakers might try to break up Facebook, he replied, adamantly, that such a move would be a mistake. The field is “extremely competitive,” he told me. “I think sometimes people get into this mode of ‘Well, there’s not, like, an exact replacement for Facebook.’ Well, actually, that makes it _more_ competitive, because what we really are is a system of different things: we compete with Twitter as a broadcast medium; we compete with Snapchat as a broadcast medium; we do messaging, and iMessage is default-installed on every iPhone.” He acknowledged the deeper concern. “There’s this other question, which is just, laws aside, how do we feel about these tech companies being big?” he said. But he argued that efforts to “curtail” the growth of Facebook or other Silicon Valley heavyweights would cede the field to China. “I think that anything that we’re doing to constrain them will, first, have an impact on how successful we can be in other places,” he said. “I wouldn’t worry in the near term about Chinese companies or anyone else winning in the U.S., for the most part. But there are all these places where there are day-to-day more competitive situations—in Southeast Asia, across Europe, Latin America, lots of different places.”\n\nThe rough consensus in Washington is that regulators are unlikely to try to break up Facebook. The F.T.C. will almost certainly fine the company for violations, and may consider blocking it from buying big potential competitors, but, as a former F.T.C. commissioner told me, “in the United States you’re allowed to have a monopoly position, as long as you achieve it and maintain it without doing illegal things.”\n\nFacebook is encountering tougher treatment in Europe, where antitrust laws are stronger and the history of fascism makes people especially wary of intrusions on privacy. One of the most formidable critics of Silicon Valley is the [European Union](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/european-union)’s top antitrust regulator, Margrethe Vestager. Last year, after an investigation of Google’s search engine, Vestager accused the company of giving an “illegal advantage” to its shopping service and fined it $2.7 billion, at that time the largest fine ever imposed by the E.U. in an antitrust case. In July, she added another five-billion-dollar fine for the company’s practice of requiring device makers to preinstall Google apps.\n\nIn Brussels, Vestager is a high-profile presence—nearly six feet tall, with short black-and-silver hair. She grew up in rural Denmark, the eldest child of two Lutheran pastors, and, when I spoke to her recently, she talked about her enforcement powers in philosophical terms. “What we’re dealing with, when people start doing something illegal, is exactly as old as Adam and Eve,” she said. “Human decisions very often are guided by greed, by fear of being pushed out of the marketplace, or of losing something that’s important to you. And then, if you throw power into that cocktail of greed and fear, you have something that you can recognize throughout time.”\n\nVestager told me that her office has no open cases involving Facebook, but she expressed concern that the company was taking advantage of users, beginning with terms of service that she calls “unbalanced.” She paraphrased those terms as “It’s your data, but you give us a royalty-free global license to do, basically, whatever we want.” Imagine, she said, if a brick-and-mortar business asked to copy all your photographs for its unlimited, unspecified uses. “Your children, from the very first day until the confirmation, the rehearsal dinner for the wedding, the wedding itself, the first child being baptized. You would never accept that,” she said. “But this is what you accept without a blink of an eye when it’s digital.”\n\nIn Vestager’s view, a healthy market should produce competitors to Facebook that position themselves as ethical alternatives, collecting less data and seeking a smaller share of user attention. “We need social media that will allow us to have a nonaddictive, advertising-free space,” she said. “You’re more than welcome to be successful and to dramatically outgrow your competitors if customers like your product. But, if you grow to be dominant, you have a special responsibility not to misuse your dominant position to make it very difficult for others to compete against you and to attract potential customers. Of course, we keep an eye on it. If we get worried, we will start looking.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cf477b8357353ab503]||||||\n+++\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs the pressure on Facebook has intensified, the company has been moving to fix its vulnerabilities. In December, after Sean Parker and Chamath Palihapitiya spoke publicly about the damaging psychological effects of social media, Facebook acknowledged evidence that heavy use can exacerbate anxiety and loneliness. After years of perfecting addictive features, such as “auto-play” videos, it announced a new direction: it would promote the quality, rather than the quantity, of time spent on the site. The company modified its algorithm to emphasize updates from friends and family, the kind of content most likely to promote “active engagement.” In a post, Zuckerberg wrote, “We can help make sure that Facebook is time well spent.”\n\nThe company also grappled with the possibility that it would once again become a vehicle for election-season propaganda. In 2018, hundreds of millions of people would be voting in elections around the world, including in the U.S. midterms. After years of lobbying against requirements to disclose the sources of funding for political ads, the company announced that users would now be able to look up who paid for a political ad, whom the ad targeted, and which other ads the funders had run.\n\nSamidh Chakrabarti, the product manager in charge of Facebook’s “election integrity” work, told me that the revelations about Russia’s Internet Research Agency were deeply alarming. “This wasn’t the kind of product that any of us thought that we were working on,” he said. With the midterms approaching, the company had discovered that Russia’s model for exploiting Facebook had inspired a generation of new actors similarly focussed on skewing political debate. “There are lots of copycats,” Chakrabarti said.\n\nZuckerberg used to rave about the virtues of “frictionless sharing,” but these days Facebook is working on “imposing friction” to slow the spread of disinformation. In January, the company hired Nathaniel Gleicher, the former director for cybersecurity policy on President Obama’s National Security Council, to blunt “information operations.” In July, it removed thirty-two accounts running disinformation campaigns that were traced to Russia. A few weeks later, it removed more than six hundred and fifty accounts, groups, and pages with links to Russia or Iran. Depending on your point of view, the removals were a sign either of progress or of the growing scale of the problem. Regardless, they highlighted the astonishing degree to which the security of elections around the world now rests in the hands of Gleicher, Chakrabarti, and other employees at Facebook.\n\nAs hard as it is to curb election propaganda, Zuckerberg’s most intractable problem may lie elsewhere—in the struggle over which opinions can appear on Facebook, which cannot, and who gets to decide. As an engineer, Zuckerberg never wanted to wade into the realm of content. Initially, Facebook tried blocking certain kinds of material, such as posts featuring nudity, but it was forced to create long lists of exceptions, including images of breast-feeding, “acts of protest,” and works of art. Once Facebook became a venue for political debate, the problem exploded. In April, in a call with investment analysts, Zuckerberg said glumly that it was proving “easier to build an A.I. system to detect a nipple than what is hate speech.”\n\nThe cult of growth leads to the curse of bigness: every day, a billion things were being posted to Facebook. At any given moment, a Facebook “content moderator” was deciding whether a post in, say, Sri Lanka met the standard of hate speech or whether a dispute over Korean politics had crossed the line into bullying. Zuckerberg sought to avoid banning users, preferring to be a “platform for all ideas.” But he needed to prevent Facebook from becoming a swamp of hoaxes and abuse. His solution was to ban “hate speech” and impose lesser punishments for “misinformation,” a broad category that ranged from crude deceptions to simple mistakes. Facebook tried to develop rules about how the punishments would be applied, but each idiosyncratic scenario prompted more rules, and over time they became byzantine. According to Facebook training slides published by the _Guardian_ last year, moderators were told that it was permissible to say “You are such a Jew” but not permissible to say “Irish are the best, but really French sucks,” because the latter was defining another people as “inferiors.” Users could not write “Migrants are scum,” because it is dehumanizing, but they could write “Keep the horny migrant teen-agers away from our daughters.” The distinctions were explained to trainees in arcane formulas such as “Not Protected + Quasi protected = not protected.”\n\nIn July, the issue landed, inescapably, in Zuckerberg’s lap. For years, Facebook had provided a platform to the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, whose delusions include that the parents of children killed in the [Sandy Hook school massacre](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/newtown-shooting) are paid actors with an anti-gun agenda. Facebook was loath to ban Jones. When people complained that his rants violated rules against harassment and fake news, Facebook experimented with punishments. At first, it “reduced” him, tweaking the algorithm so that his messages would be shown to fewer people, while feeding his fans articles that fact-checked his assertions.\n\nThen, in late July, Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, the parents of Noah Pozner, a child killed at Sandy Hook, published an open letter addressed “Dear Mr Zuckerberg,” in which they described “living in hiding” because of death threats from conspiracy theorists, after “an almost inconceivable battle with Facebook to provide us with the most basic of protections.” In their view, Zuckerberg had “deemed that the attacks on us are immaterial, that providing assistance in removing threats is too cumbersome, and that our lives are less important than providing a safe haven for hate.”\n\nFacebook relented, somewhat. On July 27th, it took down four of Jones’s videos and suspended him for a month. But public pressure did not let up. On August 5th, the dam broke after Apple, saying that the company “does not tolerate hate speech,” stopped distributing five podcasts associated with Jones. Facebook shut down four of Jones’s pages for “repeatedly” violating rules against hate speech and bullying. I asked Zuckerberg why Facebook had wavered in its handling of the situation. He was prickly about the suggestion: “I don’t believe that it is the right thing to ban a person for saying something that is factually incorrect.”\n\nJones seemed a lot more than factually incorrect, I said.\n\n“O.K., but I think the facts here are pretty clear,” he said, homing in. “The _initial_ questions were around misinformation.” He added, “We don’t take it down and ban people unless it’s directly inciting violence.” He told me that, after Jones was reduced, more complaints about him flooded in, alerting Facebook to older posts, and that the company was debating what to do when Apple announced its ban. Zuckerberg said, “When they moved, it was, like, O.K., we shouldn’t just be sitting on this content and these enforcement decisions. We should move on what we know violates the policy. We need to make a decision now.”\n\nIt will hardly be the last quandary of this sort. Facebook’s free-speech dilemmas have no simple answers—you don’t have to be a fan of Alex Jones to be unnerved by the company’s extraordinary power to silence a voice when it chooses, or, for that matter, to amplify others, to pull the levers of what we see, hear, and experience. Zuckerberg is hoping to erect a scalable system, an orderly decision tree that accounts for every eventuality and exception, but the boundaries of speech are a bedevilling problem that defies mechanistic fixes. The Supreme Court, defining obscenity, landed on “I know it when I see it.” For now, Facebook is making do with a Rube Goldberg machine of policies and improvisations, and opportunists are relishing it. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, seized on the ban of Jones as a fascist assault on conservatives. In a moment that was rich even by Cruz’s standards, he quoted Martin Niemöller’s famous lines about the Holocaust, saying, “As the poem goes, you know, ‘First they came for Alex Jones.’&#160;”\n\nLast week, testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sandberg said, “We now have over twenty thousand people and we are able to review reports in fifty languages, twenty-four hours a day.” (In the hallway before the session, as if to underscore the complexities ahead, Alex Jones had made a scene, heckling Senator Marco Rubio for not doing more to get him back on Facebook.) In recent years, Sandberg has gained fame for her work outside the company, including her books, “Lean In,” a best-seller on women’s empowerment, and “Option B,” which she wrote after the sudden death of her husband, Dave Goldberg. But her responsibility for the Facebook fallout is likely to grow, and her reputation as C.O.O. hinges on the implementation of changes. Many people in Silicon Valley believe that Sandberg and Facebook’s board of directors must do more to prevent the company from making another major mistake. “I know a couple of guys who are color-blind,” a prominent executive told me, “and their wives lay their clothes out for them in the morning if they don’t want to go out every day looking like Bozo the Clown. Sheryl and the board are expected to lay the clothes out for Mark.” He went on, “If you have blind spots, then you rely on the people around you to tell you where they are.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn one of our conversations, I asked Zuckerberg whether he finds it insulting when people speculate that he lacks emotions. “Insulting?” he asked, and then paused for several seconds to consider. “I don’t find it insulting. I don’t think it’s _accurate_. I mean, I definitely care a lot. There’s a difference between letting emotions drive impulsive decisions and caring.” He went on, “Ultimately, I think the reason that we built this successful thing is because we just solve problem after problem after problem, and typically you don’t do that by making impulsive, emotional decisions.”\n\nThe caricature of Zuckerberg is that of an automaton with little regard for the human dimensions of his work. The truth is something else: he decided long ago that no historical change is painless. Like Augustus, he is at peace with his trade-offs. Between speech and truth, he chose speech. Between speed and perfection, he chose speed. Between scale and safety, he chose scale. His life thus far has convinced him that he can solve “problem after problem after problem,” no matter the howling from the public it may cause.\n\nAt a certain point, the habits of mind that served Zuckerberg well on his ascent will start to work against him. To avoid further crises, he will have to embrace the fact that he’s now a protector of the peace, not a disrupter of it. Facebook’s colossal power of persuasion has delivered fortune but also peril. Like it or not, Zuckerberg is a gatekeeper. The era when Facebook could learn by doing, and fix the mistakes later, is over. The costs are too high, and idealism is not a defense against negligence.\n\nIn some sense, the “Mark Zuckerberg production”—as he called Facebook in its early years—has only just begun. Zuckerberg is not yet thirty-five, and the ambition with which he built his empire could well be directed toward shoring up his company, his country, and his name. The question is not whether Zuckerberg has the power to fix Facebook but whether he has the will; whether he will kick people out of his office—with the gusto that he once mustered for the pivot to mobile—if they don’t bring him ideas for preventing violence in Myanmar, or protecting privacy, or mitigating the toxicity of social media. He succeeded, long ago, in making Facebook great. The challenge before him now is to make it good. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark Zuckerberg","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mark-zuckerberg"},{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c7841c92e2c9b85da16","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Technology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"technology"},{"id":"5c2e1c9936cecf4019214208","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Silicon Valley","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"silicon-valley"},{"id":"5c2e1c83e56e652c90274671","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Social Media","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"social-media"},{"id":"5c2e1df92bc86f2c9a244b40","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tech Companies","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tech-companies"},{"id":"5c2e1f33397f5b30646d086e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Chief Executive Officers (C.E.O.s)","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"chief-executive-officers-ceos"},{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2016 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2016-election"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a18798b51cf59fc42477f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Profiles","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"profiles"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a02cf1c7a8e33fb390be6","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Evan Osnos joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2008 and covers politics and foreign affairs.

In it, players join a peacekeeping force that’s sent to Washington, D.C., after a terrorist attack incites anarchy and closes the government.\n\nFour hours after the initial e-mail, Ubisoft sent a second message apologizing for the first. “We recognize the very real impact of the United States government shut down on thousands of people and did not intend to make light of the situation,” it read. This was the company’s latest attempt to claim that the game has no political stance, despite its premise, and that any likeness to current events is purely cosmetic. “We’re definitely not making any political statements,” Terry Spier, the game’s creative director, [told a reporter](https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/12/17451688/the-division-2-is-not-making-any-political-statements) last summer.\n\nAccording to Ubisoft, The Division 2 is about political dissension in much the same way that the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, at Disneyland, is about robbery on the high seas. When one plays the game, which is out on Friday, this claim can seem to break down. The Division 2 opens with a sprint across the South Lawn past insurgent fighters and toward a White House that features charred walls and pocked pillars. You are free to wander inside the Presidential residence, which has been turned into a military base. Then you head out into the surrounding shantytowns, where you find debris, dogs, and homemade banners that read “Where is the aid?” and “Fuck the government.” An assortment of virtual weaponry offers the only conduit through which peace may be restored.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nGames have long reflected the political realities in which they are made. Usually, the reflections are straightforward: in the 1980 arcade game Missile Command, which arrived in the midst of the Cold War, you must save six American cities from nuclear attack by shooting down missiles before they strike. Sometimes, though, a game serves as bald propaganda. Suffragetto was an early-twentieth-century board game that framed the emancipation of women as a street fight between police constables and suffragettes on the steps of London’s Albert Hall. In the 1936 anti-Semitic board game Juden Raus!, or Jews Out!, players take turns moving pointed-hat-wearing tokens toward collection points. The first player to deport six of these tokens is declared the winner.\n\nIn recent years, video-game developers have continued to borrow politically charged settings while arguing that, unlike Suffragetto or Juden Raus!, their games remain, as Ubisoft’s C.E.O. put it, [politically impartial](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jun/25/ubisoft-tom-clancy-division-2-politics-criticism). Partly, this is a result of backlash from players. “Publishers are aware that there is a militant fringe of gamers that don’t want to see any politics, or, at least, progressive politics, in their hobby,” Paolo Pedercini, an Italian game designer who teaches experimental-game design at the School of Art at Carnegie Mellon University, said. “They may not represent a majority, but they are vocal and eager to start another battle in the ongoing culture war.”\n\nThe most prominent of these wars was [Gamergate](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/gamergate-scandal-erupts-video-game-community), which erupted in 2014. The Gamergate hashtag, popularized by the actor Adam Baldwin, was used more than a million times on Twitter, often to coördinate e-mail and phone campaigns aimed at companies whose games the movement’s proponents disagreed with or at individuals—women or minorities, in particular—who were considered to have a progressive political agenda. In the years since, even seemingly benign game features have met lingering resistance. In 2018, when the developers of the Second World War-set game Battlefield V announced that the game would include female soldiers, critics claimed that the decision was a symptom of political correctness; they created the hashtag #NotMyBattlefield and set up online petitions demanding a reversal. The message was clear: if a video-game publisher made a political commentary, or seemed to be making one, it risked damaging its bottom line. \n\nSome publishers have refused to budge. (“[Either accept it or don’t buy the game](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/319787/This_is_not_okay_EA_minces_no_words_on_backlash_against_women_in_Battlefield.php),” Electronic Arts’ chief creative officer, Patrick Söderlund, said in response to the Battlefield controversy.) But others have adopted a cautious, almost self-censoring approach. Walt Williams, the writer of Spec Ops: The Line, a blockbuster that provided an unusually forthright exploration of post-traumatic stress disorder in the military, was asked by the game’s publisher, 2K Games, to avoid all references to the Middle East. While working on Neverwinter Nights 2, the writer Chris Avellone was asked by the game’s license-holder, Wizards of the Coast, not to make a character bisexual. (“Wizards’ approach has changed in subsequent years,” Avellone told me.) The 2016 game Deus Ex: Mankind Divided was set in an apartheid society in which “Augs”—people with mechanical enhancements, such as bionic limbs or brain interfaces—were pit against those who remained “natural.” The game also included slogans such as “Augs Lives Matters.” But André Vu, a spokesman for the game’s publisher, Square-Enix, described the similarity to Black Lives Matter as merely an “unfortunate coincidence.”\n\nThis sort of strategy—an eagerness to borrow the aesthetics and frisson of a political theme without addressing that theme explicitly—faces its own criticism, both from players and from those who work in the industry. Far Cry 5, a recent game from Ubisoft, was set in rural Montana, and saw you play as a local cop facing civil disobedience from a fanatical militia group. The substance of the game was similar to previous entries in the Far Cry series, which were set in places such as Africa, the Himalayas, and Micronesia, but in relocating to Trump-era America—a more proximate locale for much of the game’s audience—the game appeared to reflect current affairs. This, in turn, created an expectation that the game’s developers would supply a commentary that they did not, in fact, provide. For critics, exploiting only the superficial aspects of the setting was both opportunistic and a waste of a valuable platform.\n\nThese tensions are not unique to video games. In 2016, one of the writers of “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” tweeted that [the Galactic Empire represented](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-writers-get-political-will-anti-trump-tweets-hurt-rogue-one-949023) “a white supremacist (human) organization.” After alt-right protesters called for a boycott of the film, Bob Iger, the chief executive of Disney, pushed back, saying that “Rogue One” was not, “in any way, a political film.” Still, something inherent to video games makes it easier for their creators to claim political neutrality. “Games are designed so that they elevate the expression of players above that of the developer,” Williams said. “You have to find the right balance between artistic intention and player agency. Publishers don’t want to admit that a game might have a political stance or message, because to do so creates player-character dissonance before the game has even been released. They think, How can this character be me, if their actions support a political stance that I do not?”\n\nThe notion of player agency, arguably the medium’s only unique ingredient, gives video-game directors license to be politically ambiguous. Ken Levine, the director of the Bioshock series, which examines failed utopias, has claimed that his games function as [political Rorschach tests](http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/13/bioshock-infinite-interview-ken-levine-racism-history/). “Bioshock Infinite was interpreted by some as a criticism of the Tea Party and by others of Occupy Wall Street,” Pedercini said. “It’s a way to infuse a dumb shooting game with a sense of importance, a way to give the idea of dealing with serious and complex issues while withdrawing from any controversial position or judgment.”\n\nIn this way, the video game could be seen as akin to the novel, a form that, more than it suggests or imposes a world view, invites the consumer to consider a theme or inhabit an issue. But, for some, this view ignores the reality of the genre. Tom Bissell, a writer for several blockbuster video games and a [contributor](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/tom-bissell) to this magazine, believes that it’s impossible for video-game publishers to distance themselves from politics, especially if a game revolves around guns. “All shooting games are inherently political, because they all put forth a vision of violent force being an acceptable catalyst for change,” he said. “You can contextualize, rationalize, or ignore that subtext as much as you want, but it’s there, inescapably, in every shooter.” For Bissell, if a game’s mechanics show that life is cheap and force is effective, then this is the message that players will receive, regardless of the words that writers place in the characters’ mouths.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe inability of blockbuster video games to present a coherent political message is, to some degree, a result of the way in which they are constructed. Robert Yang, a professor at New York University’s Game Center, is a one-man designer of political games. (A recent example, Hurt Me Plenty, is a provocative gay-spanking simulator, designed to explore sexuality and consent.) When a game is the product of an individual or small team’s vision, Yang said, it’s easy to promote a coherent message. On larger games, however, a studio must often divide different character arcs among a team of writers. “This industrial approach treats writing as an asset they plug into the game, instead of a holistic-design ethos to the entire project,” Yang said. “The more ambitious political open-world games require a lot of coördination and strong authorial voice and risks.”\n\nTaking those risks requires supporting structures that, in Pedercini’s view, the industry lacks. “The parallel with the film industry is useful,” he said. “A politically uncompromising film like ‘[Sorry to Bother You](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/sorry-to-bother-you-reviewed-a-wild-workplace-comedy-energized-by-righteous-anger)’ became a blockbuster, but its production would not have been possible without Sundance and a whole supportive ecosystem.” Video games have no such ecosystem; as Yang put it, the medium is in the process of reverse-engineering an art form from an entertainment business. “We have to build the arts-and-culture platforms and the festival circuits,” Yang said. “We have to convince funding bodies and governments that games are worth more than their sales numbers.”\n\nIn the meantime, there is the steady drip of change. “The industry is slowly starting to embrace more diverse storytelling and characterization,” Rhianna Pratchett, a former lead writer on the Tomb Raider series, said. She was referring to [a recent trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmN-bWwv0A) for the blockbuster game The Last of Us 2, which features a scripted lesbian kiss between two teen-age girls. (Tellingly, the first gay kiss in video games, in The Sims, [was an accident](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-kiss-that-changed-video-games).) “But it’s baby steps,” Pratchett continued. “We are still learning how to talk about these things. We are still working out how to be brave.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c992bc86f2c9a2449d9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c992bc86f2c9a2449d9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Video

He described the thrill as being “as close to sexual satisfaction as you could possibly get.” The feeling was shared, seemingly, by many youths in the Britain of the early nineteen-eighties, when there was little economic opportunity for the working class. Before the industrialization of video games—the great American software factories and their nameless workers—these teens staged a quiet revolution from their bedrooms, designing games on home microprocessors. Those who managed to place their games into high-street retailers, such as WHSmith, became rich. Like pop stars, they were often only slightly older than their fans, and their work was followed with cultish obsession.\n\nThis historical moment provides the setting for “Bandersnatch,” a new episode of the writer [Charlie Brooker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/the-speculative-dread-of-black-mirror)’s “[Black Mirror](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/05/button-pusher).” The episode, which débuted on Netflix last week, follows Stefan Butler (Fionn Whitehead), a nervy young programmer who, after finding a choose-your-own-adventure-style fantasy novel that belonged to his late mother, begins adapting it into a video game. Butler works from his aromatic bedroom, in a house he still shares with his father. As a means of escape, he considers selling the game, and takes an unfinished version to a publishing house run by the grinningly opportunistic Mohan Thakur (Asim Chaudhry). There he meets one of his heroes, the game designer Colin Ritman (Will Poulter), who personifies the high-flying, bespectacled teen auteur Butler dreams of becoming. Thakur bids to publish Butler’s game, which is called Bandersnatch—a reference to a real game of the era that famously never came out—and offers Butler help to finish the game and a luxurious advertising campaign to promote it.  \n\nBut the decision to take up Thakur’s offer rests not with Butler but with you, the viewer. Unlike most episodes of “[Black Mirror](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/with-black-mirror-our-dystopia-gets-the-television-show-it-deserves),” “Bandersnatch” is not a tale about the devastating potential of technology. It’s a work of interactive fiction—a nonlinear story in which we steer the plot via simple A/B choices that occur at key moments in the drama. In the Choose Your Own Adventure novels, which popularized the form in the nineteen-eighties, decisions were made by turning to a specified page number, where the readers could pick up their chosen narrative thread. In “Bandersnatch,” these decisions—which range from choosing which cereal Butler should eat to choosing if he should jump off a balcony—are made via the TV remote. (If you fail to pick an option, one is chosen for you, to keep the drama chugging.) Each path winds to one of a clutch of possible endings, some of which are abrupt and unsatisfying, others of which unravel the story’s mysteries. Some endings even invite the viewer to return to a previous scene, implying that he or she took a wrong turn in the road.\n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: /photos/5c2e2ed68c8f962cd419cd65]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nInteractive fiction, or I.F., is an old and treasured mode of video-game design. Per the veteran designer Sid Meier, a video game is a series of interesting choices; in many ways, the multi-branched story is the purest expression of that idea. “Bandersnatch” is a Netflix episode, so it’s by necessity simpler than many I.F. games, but it also demonstrates both the enduring allure of the format and its exasperating limitations.\n\nThe upside of the form is that steering a story onscreen, with live actors playing out your choices, has a wild magic. But what’s gained in autonomy is often lost in dramatic impact. I.F. can be a wasteful vehicle for storytelling. Every plot branch multiplies the writer’s work while dividing the proportion of that work that will be seen by players. With every new crossroad, each path becomes more obscure. And every choice made is accompanied by a melancholic chaser, the feeling that we’re missing out on a different, perhaps more satisfying story.  \n\nThe best examples of I.F. cut and chop their story segments in ways that minimize wastefulness. Sam Barlow’s “Her Story,” a thriller released in 2015, presents you with a database of three hundred film clips, which are culled from police tapes filmed during a murder investigation. You can’t access the clips in chronological sequence. Instead, you use search terms to query the database, and clips that contain your term (e.g., “affair,” or “murder”) are retrieved for viewing. The story is pieced together in the mind as a jigsaw and only fully known when you uncover every clip through informed guesswork. (Barlow’s work in bringing I.F. to the small screen was the subject of [a piece in *The New Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/alternate-endings) in 2017.)\n\nBrooker, who began his career as a journalist covering video games, was more tightly bound than Barlow, both by the limits of Netflix’s technology and by the need to appeal to a broad and broadly inexpert audience. His response was to acknowledge, in the episode, the foibles of the I.F. form. During a late-night recreational drug-taking session, Colin Ritman, the rock-star programmer, explains to Butler that he believes in the multiverse. Death, he explains, isn’t the end; we inevitably go on living in another time line. This theme gives Brooker license to send viewers back to key crossroads, forcing them to rewatch a portion of the episode before making a different choice.\n\nIt’s an ingenious solution, one that turns the game into something like a treasure hunt; the viewer is invited to seek out each pathway and build a four-dimensional picture of the plot’s narrative possibilities. This design minimizes wastefulness, but it also allays our fear of missing out. We can explore various courses of action before settling on our preferred route. There are few such chances in life, where we live with our choices and their repercussions. In its way, “Bandersnatch” offers an antidote to regret.\n\nAnd yet omniscience, it seems, isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. One of the thrills of fiction is seeing the ways in which characters respond to miserable circumstances and their own suboptimal choices. Similarly, one of the thrills of a video game is the chance to work our way out of a disaster of our own making. It’s the pleasure of emptying the Tetris bucket of blocks after a series of missteps, and it’s the satisfaction of watching that final space invader explode, like an iridescent dandelion, seconds before it smacks into your home base.\n\n“Bandersnatch”&nbsp;’s do-overs lighten the weight of our decisions, which in turn lightens the gravity of the whole. It’s an exhilarating experiment, not least because it’s played out on such a major stage, and on one of Netflix’s prestige properties. Much of the episode’s success, however, relies on the clever marriage of theme and mechanism. Without this, the flimsiness of the supporting framework, more gimmick than revolution, would be exposed.

(The wooers include [Steve Bannon](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/steve-bannon), when he was the executive chairman of Breitbart News, and the former Breitbart editor [Milo Yiannopoulos](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/02/how-social-media-trolls-turned-uc-berkeley-into-a-free-speech-circus), who churned out posts with titles such as “Feminist Bullies Tearing the Video Game Industry Apart.”) This scheme has proved effective. Last month, a YouTube user uploaded a clip from the recent blockbuster video game Red Dead Redemption 2, a cowboy playpen set in the late-nineteenth-century American Southwest. In it, the player guides his character toward a computer-controlled suffragette who is campaigning for her right to vote, and punches her unconscious. The video, titled “Beating Up Annoying Feminist,” has  been viewed more than 1\\.7 million times, with a chorus of support in the comments below.\n\nThis kind of trolling can easily escalate. Earlier this month, [NPR broadcast a story](https://www.npr.org/2018/11/05/660642531/right-wing-hate-groups-are-recruiting-video-gamers) in which a father recounted his dismay at finding a neo-Nazi pamphlet that his fifteen-year-old son had printed out after being encouraged by fellow-gamers. “I was crying,” the man said. “I felt like a failure that a child that I had raised would be remotely interested in that sort of stuff.”\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5c06ddcc04d74a2d12344fa1]||||||\n\n+++\n\nThe cultural problems around video games, of course, inhere not just in their young players but in their creators. There remains a woeful lack of diversity among those who design video games, and, in the industry at large, among those who decide what kinds of games are made in the first place. But the tectonic plates still shift, slowly, and, at the edges, work of intelligence and interest is produced. While 2018 was hardly a vintage year for video games, there were releases that nevertheless excited, stimulated, and challenged their audiences to think for themselves. Here are nine.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Return of the Obra Dinn (PC, Mac)__\n\nThe Obra Dinn, an East Indiaman merchant ship, was thought to be lost at sea until, one day in 1808, a vessel bearing its name drifts into port. As an insurance-loss adjuster, you must figure out what happened to the crew members, whose bodies litter the ship’s nooks and decks. Much like [Papers, Please](https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/14/4329676/papers-please-a-game-about-an-immigration-inspector), the designer Lucas Pope’s previous game, in which you played as an agent at an Eastern European border checkpoint, the story is told through the lens of a mundane vocation. This time, however, there is a touch of the mystical: a magic pocket watch, found in a casket dredged from the sea, enables you to trigger a flashback whenever you happen upon a corpse. You can then trace the person’s final moments in a frozen diorama, and unearth both his identity and cause of death. The game’s scratchy, black-and-white art style, a tribute to the Mac Plus, uses blank space and dots to create the illusion of shading. It’s the ideal aesthetic for a story in which you work to shake a picture from the noise.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Tetris Effect (PlayStation 4)__\n\nDespite more than thirty years of effort, Tetris’s sequels have, in the main, failed to supersede the original. Designed in 1984 by the Russian engineer Alexei Pajitnov, Tetris, as most people know, requires one to stack a cascade of tetromino shapes as they descend into a bucket. Form an unbroken line across the width of the bucket and the line disappears, creating more room. It’s an idea that arrived so perfectly formed that no designer has managed to improve it. Until, that is, Tetris Effect, which was designed by the Japanese musician Tetsuya Mizuguchi. Mizuguchi adds to the game a layer of musical notes and effects, which harmonize with both the dance soundtrack and the movement of the pieces. The result is a game in which every moment fizzes with wonder. Like Disney’s “Fantasia,” which yoked animation to music, it’s a simple idea that, through exquisite execution, elevates Tetris to something novel and thrilling.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Red Dead Redemption 2 (PlayStation 4, Xbox One)__\n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: /photos/5bff1dbc975e74178e5aa12e]||||||\n\n+++\n\nIn film, television, and, to a lesser extent, literature, storytelling is the business of imposing order on the chaos of life. Usually, this involves editing out the extraneous bits. By contrast, Red Dead Redemption 2, the latest game by the Grand Theft Auto creator Rockstar, seeks to embellish its essential story—which follows a group of outlaws in the twilight of the Old West—with endless, intricate diversions. From bear hunting to dominoes, debt collecting to heavy drinking, the extracurricular expanse is at once exhilarating and faintly exhausting. But it also establishes a keen sense of time and place, one that’s more tactile than anything in film or on TV. In fact, most of the wonder is found when one wanders off-script: if you prefer not to rob a train, you can perch on top of one of its carriages as the world lazily puffs by. It’s a notable leap forward for the open-world video game, but its success may have come at the cost of those who created it. (Its launch was dogged by stories of Rockstar’s exploitative working practices.)\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Into the Breach (PC, Nintendo Switch)__\n\nA claustrophobic riff on chess, Into the Breach asks you to nudge and shunt three robots around an eight-by-eight grid, taking turns to do battle with giant earthworms called Vek. The sci-fi theme is, broadly, irrelevant. This is a knotty little strategy game, as elegant and carefully calibrated as any of the board-game greats. With no time limit to hustle you toward action, there is time to consider each move and its knock-on consequences, which ripple not only across a given battle but through the entire campaign as you seek to build up your arsenal for the final showdown. What makes Into the Breach unique is that you can see what move each Vek will make next, and in what order. This allows you to foil their plans, shunt them into positions where their attacks will miss, or mitigate inevitable losses. For a game with such a modest canvas—each battle lasts just five turns— these dynamic, shape-shifting puzzles have time-gobbling depths.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Florence (iOS)__\n\nFlorence, a wordless, illustrated story about the bloom and wilt of a twentysomething woman’s courtship, has only a light seasoning of interaction, and no capacity for its player to change the course of the story. In this way, both player and protagonist share—from the first shoots of attraction to the monotonous routine of a long-term relationship—a sense of inevitability. We share, too, the unthinking to-dos of domesticity: tidying the cluttered shoes, bagging the groceries, brushing teeth. These idle, near throwaway interactions, when taken in concert, build a truthful portrait. Beneath the surface, however, this is a story of the moment. Florence shows a woman stifling her creative urges to support those of the man she loves. The understated narrative, presented in a way that borders on twee, but never trite, contains themes of surprising weight and consequence.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__My Child Lebensborn (iOS)__\n\n+++feature-xsmall\n\n[#image: /photos/5bff1dbca080342cdf810f2d]||||||\n\n+++\n\nThe Nazi program of Lebensborn was a kind of inverse Holocaust: it involved the systematic nurture of life according to race. Unmarried Aryan women, some as young as sixteen, were made to carry the babies of S.S. officers. An estimated twelve thousand of these children were born in occupied Norway; after the war, many of them, who had been taken from their mothers at birth, were given up for adoption. In My Child Lebensborn, you assume the role of one of these adoptive parents, nurturing the social, emotional, and educational well-being of your child in a community where both of you have been cruelly ostracized. The game works like a Tamagotchi. You must keep your child clean, fed, and watered at regular intervals. The greater challenge resides in meeting the children’s emotional needs, as you help them deal with persistent bullying and advise them on whether to make contact with their biological parents. The game brings what is to many a historical footnote into sharp relief, and over time presents an affecting picture of the fragility of every child’s spirit, and the ease with which it can be ruined by adult will.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__God of War (PlayStation 4)__\n\nThe aesthetic is that of Homeric myth, with all its gore and shrieking sinew, but the narrative reflects more contemporary concerns—namely, the ways in which toxic masculinity can prevent fathers from showing love to their sons. The hero, Kratos, is something of a reborn video-game protagonist: in his previous six outings, he was no more than a monosyllabic muscleman. God of War, like its forebears, treats violence as pornography, but it also has a narrative heft, and the dynamic between Kratos and his son, as they undertake a journey to scatter the boy’s mother’s ashes on a giant mountain, is tenderly observed. In the age of the strongman, it’s revitalizing to see a powerful man explore emotional vulnerability as a martial art. And, when the psychodrama threatens to grow weary, the game is always ready with the next god or monster who needs taking down.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Forza Horizon 4 (Xbox One)__\n\nThere is pleasure to be had, of course, in driving a glittering array of supercars within a video game, where insurance premiums are yet to be found. But the real joy in the fourth game from Playground Games—a studio based in the nondescript English town of Leamington Spa—is the chance to drive those cars across the British countryside, from the wuthering Devon moors to the cobbled majesty of Edinburgh. The game plays down the realism, allowing you to hurl even the lowest-slung Italian sports car over rocks and dales, perhaps while listening to Bach’s Air on G String on the in-game radio. Racing games are ten-a-penny in this business, but no one makes them quite like the British. The Playground team, freed from having to locate their work in, say, Colorado or on the Nürburgring, have made a game that exudes a love for their homeland, in all its green, pleasant, and now tire-wrecked wonder.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Monster Hunter: World (PlayStation 4, Xbox One)__\n\nMonster hunting has been a theme in video games since Pokémon challenged us to catch ’em all. But Monster Hunter: World takes its cues from older source material, namely Victorian classics, such as Jules Verne’s “[Journey to the Center of the Earth](https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Center-Earth-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486440885/)” and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s “[The Lost World](https://www.amazon.com/Lost-World-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486400603).” You arrive in a forgotten continent filled with exotic megafauna, which must be stalked, lured, hunted, and, finally, either captured or killed, depending on whether your predilection is to study or destroy. Unlike most action games, which send you, blade extended, pirouetting through hundreds of enemies on the battlefield, here your prey is singular, and hard to take down. Hunts, which can be undertaken solo or with friends online, can take more than an hour, a delay that only heightens the sense of euphoria when you finally fell the beast. In a world that’s been meticulously plotted by satellites, here is a rare chance to rediscover the undiscovered.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n__Honorable Mentions__\n\nMinit (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC)\n\nSpider-Man (PlayStation 4)\n\nDead Cells (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC)\n\nCeleste (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC)","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c992bc86f2c9a2449d9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Video Games","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"video-games"},{"id":"5c2e1c7836cecf40192141c4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2018 in Review","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2018-in-review"},{"id":"5c2e1c7841c92e2c9b85da16","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Technology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"technology"},{"id":"5c2e1c982bc86f2c9a2449d8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Gaming","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"gaming"}],"sections":[{"id":"5bfec45e7556b72d483911ef","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2018 in Review","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2018-in-review"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a04a38b51cf59fc424715","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Simon Parkin is a contributing writer to *The New Yorker*.

It was a view shared by other contemporary critics. One [called the book](http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1534&context=wwqr) “intensely vulgar, nay, absolutely beastly,” before bluntly refusing to tell readers where it might be bought. Whitman did not idly nurse his wounds. Instead, he anonymously wrote numerous flattering appraisals of his work, to even the balance. A [three-thousand-word example](https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/lg1855/anc.00176.html), published in the September, 1855, edition of the United States *Review*, opens with the breathless declaration, “An American bard at last!” Whitman goes on to extravagantly applaud his dress sense (“manly and free”), his posture (“strong and erect”), his voice (“bringing hope and prophecy to the generous races of young and old”), and his compassion (“the largest lover and sympathizer that has appeared in literature.”)\n\nThe temptation to pose as an impartial reviewer of one’s own work will be familiar to many authors across history. But the Internet has, as with all vices, smoothed the transition from temptation to action. When presented with the user-review box on Amazon, it’s a simple matter for an author to tap on the five-star icon and offer an “Exquisite” or a “Triumph!” For those caught in the act, the humiliation can be severe. In 2012, the crime writer R. J. Ellory was accused on Twitter by one of his rivals, Jeremy Duns, of writing “long, purple tributes to his own work on Amazon.” Under the pseudonym Nicodemus Jones, Duns said, Ellory had described his book “[A Quiet Belief in Angels](https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Belief-Angels-Novel/dp/1590203380)” as “magnificent” and “poetic,” even going so far as to warn potential buyers to “ignore all dissenters and naysayers.” Ellory, Duns claimed, had not stopped at self-praise; he had also posted negative reviews of other authors’ work. In [a statement issued to the *Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/03/rj-ellory-secret-amazon-reviews), Ellory admitted guilt. “The recent reviews—both positive and negative—that have been posted on my Amazon accounts are my responsibility and my responsibility alone,” he wrote. “I wholeheartedly regret the lapse of judgment.”\n\nSock-puppeting, the act of posing as someone else on the Internet to artificially amplify a viewpoint, is, many writers claim, rife in publishing. The author Stephen Leather once reportedly admitted, at the Harrogate Crime Writing Festival, to building an online “network of characters” who would talk among themselves about his books in glittering terms. \n\nOutside the publishing industry, the practice known as “review brushing” exists on a vast, industrial scale. In 2014, Haitao Xu, a thirty-year-old researcher now at Northwestern University, monitored five black-market Internet boards where companies and individuals advertise jobs posting positive reviews of their products and services, along with negative ones on those of their rivals. In just two months, Xu saw more than eleven thousand unique sellers post close to a quarter of a million jobs, paid at anywhere between “tens of cents, up to five dollars,” he told me. Since consumers typically see positive customer reviews as a more reliable indicator of quality than advertising, the effects can be major. “Stores using brushing services can increase their reputation ten times faster than normal seller stores,” Xu, who, in 2016, spent six months working in Alibaba’s fraud-detection team, told me. “A store with a high reputation is displayed higher up a Web page, attracting more customers and increasing sales.” Online sellers who do not employ brushing services, meanwhile, often find their products overlooked. \n\nLate last year, Oobah Butler, a reporter at Vice, decided to [test the effectiveness of brushing in restaurant reviews](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/434gqw/i-made-my-shed-the-top-rated-restaurant-on-tripadvisor). Years ago, Butler told me, he used to write bogus reviews on TripAdvisor for money. He found his clients via freelance job postings, like those that Xu studied, and charged around twenty dollars a pop. “I’d look at the menu, pick something, and start lying,” he said. For the recent test, he created his own fake business, which he called the Shed at Dulwich. (It was named for his garden shed, in Dulwich, London.) He photographed plates of carefully arranged food (created using household products such as shaving cream and dishwasher tablets), bought a burner phone, and added the Shed to the site. Within four weeks, he had posted enough fake reviews to move the spectral establishment into the top two thousand restaurants in London. Eventually, it became the highest-rated restaurant in the city, and Butler was fielding scores of calls from people hoping to book a table. Such was the nonexistent restaurant’s success that it even attracted a one-star review, from what Butler assumes was a rival. “TripAdvisor removed the review on the grounds that it was fake,” he said.\n\nFor online retailers, the war on the fake-review industry is now a major part of the business. Today, when a review is submitted to TripAdvisor, it goes through a tracking system that examines hundreds of different attributes, from basic data points, such as the I.P. address of the reviewer, to more detailed information, such as the screen resolution of the device that was used to submit the review. “We use this data to create a map of reviews coming in for every property listed on the site, and it means we can quickly identify unusual patterns of review behavior,” James Kay, a spokesman for the company, told me. The tools, he said, have successfully identified offshore review farms. In 2015, TripAdvisor took legal action against sixty of them. \n\nIncreasingly, fake reviews are being leveraged not only for financial gain but to make a political point. Within hours of the release of Hillary Clinton’s campaign memoir, “[What Happened](https://www.amazon.com/What-Happened-Hillary-Rodham-Clinton/dp/1501175564/),” last September, so many people had left one-star ratings on Amazon that the company [deleted almost a thousand reviews](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/14/amazon-redacts-one-star-reviews-of-hillary-clintons-what-happened). The same month, the San Francisco-based video-game company Campo Santo saw one of its titles, [Firewatch](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/with-firewatch-olly-moss-brings-his-subversive-touch-to-video-games), review-bombed on Amazon, Steam, and other sites. The campaign started after the Swedish YouTube broadcaster Felix Kjellberg, a.k.a. [PewDiePie](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/15/hollywood-vine), posted a video in which he used a racial epithet. Campo Santo filed a takedown request under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, preventing PewDiePie from streaming any of its games; that was enough to mobilize a small army of fake reviewers looking to punish the developer. \n\nAn Amazon spokeswoman explained that when a product is hit with many reviews in a short period of time, the company’s systems will automatically suppress all but “verified” purchases. But this preventative measure, too, can be easily gamed. “People would buy our game, not play it, leave the terrible review, and instantly request a refund,” Sean Vanaman, Campo Santo’s co-founder, told me. “It’s a well-worn tactic.” In his estimation, user-review systems such as those used by Valve, Steam’s developer, are so vulnerable to exploitation that they require as much moderation as social-media platforms. “The ethics and utility of these systems boil down to this: if a platform is going to have it, they have to be able to manage it to protect people from abuse and harassment, or they become responsible for that abuse,” Vanaman told me last September. (His studio, Campo Santo, was bought by Valve earlier this year.)\n\nButler, the reporter who created the fake restaurant on TripAdvisor, is skeptical that the war on fake reviews is being won. “Put it this way: I’m still not banned from TripAdvisor,” he said. Kay, the company’s spokesman, claims that the Shed at Dulwich was identified as fraudulent and removed from the site completely before Butler published the story about his escapade. Butler remains unconvinced. “One way or another, the platform needs to be more sophisticated if we’re going to trust it more than what’s in front of our eyes,” he said.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762396212cbb9fc989","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Reviews","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"reviews"},{"id":"5c2e1c782bfcc72cd92d0524","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Internet","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"internet"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c22d4972cd5b83297","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Amazon","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"amazon"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f161ebe912338a3717da","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Technology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-technology"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a04a38b51cf59fc424715","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Simon Parkin is a contributing writer to *The New Yorker*.

Photographs showed workers—who are forced to sign blank contracts, work overtime, and go without safety equipment—slumped over assembly lines and sleeping in hallways. One image showed the exact American Girl doll that I’d been considering buying as a Christmas present for my six-year-old daughter. I surveyed her toys, strewn jubilantly around the living room: a Cool Maker Sew N’ Style machine, made in Vietnam; a Klutz Make Your Own Soap science kit, made in Taiwan; a pair of Kuxuan Doodle Design roller skates, made in China. The factories [highlighted](http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/report/138) by China Labor Watch have made toys for many companies, including Hasbro, Disney, Lego, and Mattel. How could I know which had been made ethically and which hadn’t?\n\n \n\nAnswering this question can be surprisingly difficult. A few years ago, while teaching a class about global labor at the University of California, Los Angeles, I tried assigning my students the task of analyzing the “supply chain”—the vast network of factories, warehouses, and shipping conduits through which products flow—by tracing the components used in their electronic devices. Almost immediately, I hit a snag: it turns out that even companies that boast about “end-to-end visibility” and “supply-chain transparency” may not know exactly where their components come from. This ignorance is built into the way supply chains work. The housing of a television, say, might be built in a small factory employing only a few people; that factory interacts only with the suppliers and buyers immediately adjacent to it in the chain—a plastic supplier on one side, an assembly company on the other. This arrangement encourages modularity, since, if a company goes out of business, its immediate partners can replace it without consulting anyone. But it also makes it hard to identify individual links in the chain. The resilient, self-healing quality of supply chains derives, in part, from the fact that they are unsupervised.\n\n \n\nWhen people try to picture supply chains, they often focus on their physical infrastructure. In Allan Sekula’s book “[Fish Story](https://www.amazon.com/Fish-Story-KINDLE-Allan-Sekula-ebook/dp/B00PSSEIC0/),” a volume of essays and photographs produced between 1989 and 1995, the writer and photographer trains his lens on ports, harbors, and the workers who pilot ships between them; he reveals dim shipboard workspaces and otherworldly industrial zones. In “The Forgotten Space,” a documentary that Sekula made with the film theorist Noël Burch, in 2010, we see massive, gliding vessels, enormous machines, and people rummaging through the detritus around ports and harbors. Sekula’s work suggests the degree to which our fantasy of friction-free procurement hides the real, often gruelling, work of global shipping and trade.\n\n \n\nBut supply chains aren’t purely physical. They’re also made of information. Modern supply-chain management, or S.C.M., is done through software. The people who design and coördinate supply chains don’t see warehouses or workers. They stare at screens filled with icons and tables. Their view of the supply chain is abstract. It may be the one that matters most.\n\n \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\n \n\nIn the S.C.M. space, a German company called *SAP*{: .small} is the market leader. Its name stands for Systeme, Anwendungen, und Produkte, or Systems, Applications, and Products. You can’t download *SAP*{: .small} from the app store; it’s an enterprise-wide suite of software, which includes modules for accounting and human resources and needs to work in tandem with a large database. It’s possible, though, to take a class online. A Texas-based company called Learn*SAP*{: .small} offers an online training course, which includes access to demo software. The course takes forty hours and costs a thousand dollars. Last summer, I signed up. (*SAP*{: .small} also offers free introductory training sessions on a platform called open*SAP*{: .small}.) \n\n \n\nBefore I logged in for the first time, I assumed that I’d be one of many students. In fact, the class was one on one. My instructor, Enugula Srinivasa Rao, lived in India, where he had a day job as a supply-chain manager for a large company. Every night for forty nights—8 *P.M.*{: .small} for me, 9:30 *A.M.*{: .small} for him—Rao and I met online. His manner, elaborately courteous and infallibly patient, inspired a similar politeness in me, so that we often performed a dance of apologies and thank-yous while navigating *SAP’s*{: .small} screens.\n\n \n\nThe newest versions of *SAP*{: .small} are sleek and colorful. But the version that I trained on—*SAP*{: .small} SCM 7, the one that’s most widely used—has a bare-bones interface, with a look and feel that evokes Microsoft Windows circa 1997\\. The main screen shows a cascade of file folders, each housing an array of “transactions”—individual tasks, such as ordering, manufacturing, packing, and shipping—that a manager can fit together to form a supply chain. Devising a chain is a multi-person process involving several different *SAP*{: .small} “components.” Into one component, a “demand specialist” enters information about past sales, seasonal variations, planned promotions, and the like; the software calculates how many products need to be made. In another, a “supply-chain specialist” uses information about shipping times, storage costs, factory capacities, and so on to create a “supply-network plan,” which dictates when each gear in the manufacturing process must turn. This high-altitude plan is then transmitted to another specialist who works in a component called PP/DS, for Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling. The PP/DS component determines how the process will unfold on the ground, allowing for the scheduling of work shifts and product movements in intervals as small as a second.\n\n \n\nThe PP/DS component looks as blandly institutional as the rest of *SAP*{: .small}. It’s more or less a series of spreadsheets, check boxes, and pop-up windows. Still, it’s where forecasts and market predictions get translated into workers’ marching orders. PP/DS features “heuristics”—built-in algorithms that distribute labor so that plants operate at their highest capacity. Running a heuristic entails clicking a button on the PP/DS interface that looks like a tiny magic wand. Click the wand, and a factory’s schedule auto-fills.\n\n \n\nDespite such labor-saving shortcuts, using *SAP*{: .small} is not easy. As the class proceeded, I felt as though I, too, were falling behind on an assembly line. Every task was more complicated than I’d imagined, with a seemingly endless variety of settings to configure; I struggled to keep the various interlocking systems arranged in my head. (It didn’t help that I sometimes clicked through *SAP*{: .small} with one hand while participating in my daughter’s craft projects with the other.) Over time, though, I started to understand the dynamics of the system as a whole. Log in to PeopleSoft, or a similar human-resource management system, and you only have access to certain modules—the ones relevant to your particular job. The same is true in *SAP*{: .small}. Most of the time, the work of supply-chain management is divided up, with handoffs where one specialist passes a package of data to another. No individual is liable to possess a detailed picture of the whole supply chain. Instead, each S.C.M. specialist knows only what her neighbors need.\n\n \n\nIn such a system, a sense of inevitability takes hold. Data dictates a set of conditions which must be met, but there is no explanation of how that data was derived; meanwhile, the software takes an active role, tweaking the plan to meet the conditions as efficiently as possible. *SAP’s*{: .small} built-in optimizers work out how to meet production needs with the least “latency” and at the lowest possible costs. (The software even suggests how tightly a container should be packed, to save on shipping charges.)  This entails that particular components become available at particular times. The consequences of this relentless optimization are well-documented. The corporations that commission products pass their computationally determined demands on to their subcontractors, who then put extraordinary pressure on their employees. Thus, China Labor Watch found that workers in Heyuan City, China, tasked with producing Disney’s Princess Sing & Sparkle Ariel Bath Doll—retail price today, $26\\.40—work twenty-six days a month, assembling between eighteen hundred and twenty-five hundred dolls per day, and earning one cent for each doll they complete.\n\n \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\n \n\nFrom the beginning of my Learn*SAP*{: .small} course, I looked forward to investigating the “Supply-Chain Cockpit,” a display that features a graphic representation of a company’s factory locations, shipping routes, and warehouses. I loved the idea of a manager strapping in like a fighter pilot to fly over a supply chain, watching it work. Rao quickly dampened my enthusiasm. “It’s not dynamic,” he explained. “It just shows the plan.” The cockpit presents only a moment of the planning process, frozen in time.\n\n \n\nA central challenge in supply-chain management is the vast distance—spatial, temporal, and informational—that separates the S.C.M. process from the real world of manufacturing and consumption. Among the distance-based problems planners worry about is the “bullwhip effect.” Suppose a store runs low on diapers. Observing this strong demand, a manager who normally needs fifty cases might put in an order for a hundred, just to be on the safe side. The diaper company, in turn, might order the production of two hundred cases, rather than a hundred, to insure that they have enough stock on hand. Just as a flick of the wrist creates waves which grow as they travel through a whip, so subtle signals sent by consumers can be amplified out of proportion as they travel through the supply chain. This inflation is dangerous for manufacturers—especially those that depend on the razor-thin inventory margins demanded by just-in-time planning—and yet it’s also hard to avoid, since the manufacturing process is so distributed in time and space, with many junctures at which forecasts might grow.\n\n \n\n*SAP’s*{: .small} demand-forecasting component is designed to help companies avoid this fate. Still, from a worker’s point of view, S.C.M. software can generate its own bullwhip effect. At the beginning of the planning process, product requirements are fairly high-level. But by the time these requirements reach workers, they have become more exacting, more punishing. Small reductions in “latency,” for instance, can magnify in consequence, reducing a worker’s time for eating her lunch, taking a breath, donning safety equipment, or seeing a loved one.\n\n \n\nCould S.C.M. software include a “workers’-rights” component—a counterpart to PP/DS, incorporating data on working conditions? Technically, it’s possible. *SAP*{: .small} could begin asking for input about worker welfare. But a component like that would be at cross-purposes with almost every other function of the system. On some level, it might even undermine the purpose of having a system in the first place. Supply chains create efficiency in part through the distribution of responsibility. If a supervisor at a toy factory objects to the production plan she’s received, her boss can wield, in his defense, a PP/DS plan sent to him by someone else, who worked with data produced by yet another person. It will turn out that no one in particular is responsible for the pressures placed on the factory. They flow from the system—a system designed to be flexible in some ways and rigid in others.

Build a booby trap out of giant magnets; dig a moat as deep as a grave. “Ever since a study by the University of Oxford predicted that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of being replaced by robots and artificial intelligence over the next fifteen to twenty years, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about the future of work,” Andrés Oppenheimer writes, in “[The Robots Are Coming: The Future of Jobs in the Age of Automation](https://www.amazon.com/Robots-Are-Coming-Future-Automation/dp/0525565000/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=The+Robots+Are+Coming%3A+The+Future+of+Jobs+in+the+Age+of+Automation&qid=1551108903&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull)” (Vintage). No one is safe. Chapter 4: “They’re Coming for Bankers!” Chapter 5: “They’re Coming for Lawyers!” They’re attacking hospitals: “They’re Coming for Doctors!” They’re headed to Hollywood: “They’re Coming for Entertainers!” I gather they have not yet come for the manufacturers of exclamation points.\n\nThe old robots were blue-collar workers, burly and clunky, the machines that rusted the Rust Belt. But, according to the economist Richard Baldwin, in “[The Globotics Upheaval: Globalization, Robotics, and the Future of Work](https://www.amazon.com/Globotics-Upheaval-Globalization-Robotics-Future/dp/0190901764/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=The+Globotics+Upheaval%3A+Globalization%2C+Robotics%2C+and+the+Future+of+Work&qid=1551108918&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull)” (Oxford), the new ones are “white-collar robots,” knowledge workers and quinoa-and-oat-milk globalists, the machines that will bankrupt Brooklyn. Mainly, they’re algorithms. Except when they’re immigrants. Baldwin calls that kind “remote intelligence,” or R.I.: they’re not exactly robots but, somehow, they fall into the same category. They’re people from other countries who can steal your job without ever really crossing the border: they just hop over, by way of the Internet and apps like Upwork, undocumented, invisible, ethereal. Between artificial intelligence and remote intelligence, Baldwin warns, “this international talent tidal wave is coming straight for the good, stable jobs that have been the foundation of middle-class prosperity in the US and Europe, and other high-wage economies.” Change your Wi-Fi password. Clear your browser history. Ask H.R. about early retirement. The globots are coming.\n\nHow can you know if you’re about to get replaced by an invading algorithm or an augmented immigrant? “If your job can be easily explained, it can be automated,” Anders Sandberg, of Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute, tells Oppenheimer. “If it can’t, it won’t.” (Rotten luck for people whose job description is “Predict the future.”) Baldwin offers three-part advice: (1) avoid competing with A.I. and R.I.; (2) build skills in things that only humans can do, in person; and (3) “realize that humanity is an edge not a handicap.” What all this means is hard to say, especially if you’ve never before considered being human to be a handicap. As for the future of humanity, Oppenheimer offers another cockamamie rule of three: “Society will be divided into three general groups. The first will be members of the elites, who will be able to adapt to the ever-changing technological landscape and who will earn the most money, followed by a second group made up primarily of those who provide personalized services to the elite, including personal trainers, Zumba class instructors, meditation gurus, piano teachers, and personal chefs, and finally a third group of those who will be mostly unemployed and may be receiving a universal basic income as compensation for being the victims of technological unemployment.”\n\nReaders of Douglas Adams will recognize this sort of hooey from “[The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy](https://www.amazon.com/Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345391802/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Hitchhiker%E2%80%99s+Guide+to+the+Galaxy&qid=1551108935&s=books&sr=1-1).” Long ago, in a galaxy not at all far away, the people of the planet Golgafrincham were divided into three groups: A, “all the brilliant leaders, the scientists, the great artists, you know, all the achievers”; B, “hairdressers, tired TV producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers, security guards, public relations executives, management consultants” (the group that everyone else considers to be “a bunch of useless idiots”); and, C, “all the people who did the actual work, who made things and did things.” The B people, told they must lead an expedition to colonize another planet, rocket away in a starship, having been led to believe that their planet is doomed. “Apparently it was going to crash into the sun or something,” the B ship’s captain tells Arthur Dent, vaguely wondering why the other ships never followed. “Or maybe it was that the moon was going to crash into us. Something of the kind. Absolutely terrifying prospect whatever it was.” Dent inquires, “And they made sure they sent you lot off first, did they?”\n\nThis time, notwithstanding [Elon Musk](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/elon-musk)’s ambition to colonize Mars, no one’s trying to persuade the B people to board a spaceship, because the B people—the hairdressers and the Zumba-class instructors, the meditation gurus and the personal trainers—are supposed to stick around to cater to the A people. No, this time it’s the C people, the people who make and do things—things that can now be made and done faster and cheaper by robots—who are being flushed down the cosmic toilet. The historian and sometime futurist Yuval Noah Harari has a name for the C people: he calls them the “useless class.” Some futurists suggest that, in our Asimov-y future, these sort of people might wind up spending their empty days playing video games. Otherwise, they’ll wage a revolution, an eventuality that the self-proclaimed “cognitive elite”—the A people, who believe themselves to be cleverer than the cleverest robots—intend to wait out in fortified lairs. (Peter Thiel owns nearly five hundred acres of land in New Zealand, complete with its own water supply.) More popular is the proposal to pay the C people for doing nothing, in order to avert the revolution. “It’s going to be necessary,” Musk said during a summit in Dubai two years ago, joining a small herd of other billionaires, including [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Mark%20Zuckerberg), of Facebook, and Stewart Butterfield, of Slack, who endorse universal basic income. It’s either that or build a wall.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nFear of a robot invasion is the obverse of fear of an immigrant invasion, a partisan coin: heads, you’re worried about robots; tails, you’re worried about immigrants. There’s just the one coin. Both fears have to do with jobs, whose loss produces suffering, want, and despair, and whose future scarcity represents a terrifying prospect. Misery likes a scapegoat: heads, blame machines; tails, foreigners. But is the present alarm warranted? Panic is not evidence of danger; it’s evidence of panic. Stoking fear of invading robots and of invading immigrants has been going on for a long time, and the predictions of disaster have, generally, been bananas. Oh, but this time it’s different, the robotomizers insist.\n\nThis thesis has been rolling around like a marble in the bowl of a lot of people’s brains for a while now, and many of those marbles were handed out by Martin Ford, in his 2015 book, “Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future.” In the book, and in an essay in “[Confronting Dystopia: The New Technological Revolution and the Future of Work](https://www.amazon.com/Confronting-Dystopia-Technological-Revolution-Future-ebook/dp/B0773XKNK8/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=Confronting+Dystopia%3A+The+New+Technological+Revolution+and+the+Future+of+Work&qid=1551108992&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull)” (Cornell), Ford acknowledges that all other earlier robot-invasion panics were unfounded. In the nineteenth century, people who worked on farms lost their jobs when agricultural processes were mechanized, but they eventually earned more money working in factories. In the twentieth century, automation of industrial production led to warnings about “unprecedented economic and social disorder.” Instead, displaced factory workers moved into service jobs. Machines eliminate jobs; rising productivity creates new jobs.\n\n“Given this long record of false alarms, contemporary economists are generally dismissive of arguments that technological progress might lead to unemployment as well as falling wages and soaring income inequality,” Ford admits. After all, “history shows that the economy has consistently adjusted to advancing technology by creating new employment opportunities and that these new jobs often require more skills and pay higher wages.”\n\nThat was then. The reason that things will be different this time, Ford argues, has to do with the changing pace of change. The transformation from an agricultural to an industrial economy was linear; the current acceleration is exponential. The first followed Newton’s law; the second follows Moore’s. The employment apocalypse, when it comes, will happen so fast that workers won’t have time to adjust by shifting to new employment sectors, and, even if they did have time to adjust, there would be no new employment sectors to go to, because robots will be able to do just about everything.\n\nIt is quite possible that this thesis is correct; it is not possible to know that it is correct. Ford, an advocate of universal basic income, is neither a historian nor an economist. He is a futurist, a modern-day shaman, with an M.B.A. Everybody thinks about the future; futurists do it for a living. Policymakers make plans; futurists read omens. The robots-are-coming omen-reading borrows as much from the conventions of science fiction as from those of historical analysis. It uses “robot” as a shorthand for everything from steam-powered looms to electricity-driven industrial assemblers and artificial intelligence, and thus has the twin effects of compressing time and conflating one thing with another. It indulges in the supposition that work is something the wealthy hand out to the poor, from feudalism to capitalism, instead of something people do, for reasons that include a search for order, meaning, and purpose. It leaves out of its accounting the largest source of labor in the United States before the Civil War, people held in bondage, and fails to consider how the rise of wage labor left women’s work uncompensated. And it ignores the brutal truth that, in American history, panic about technological change is almost always tangled up with panic about immigration. Nineteenth-century populists, those farmers left behind by the industrial revolution, wanted railroad companies to be taxed, but they also wanted to bar African-Americans and Asian immigrants from full citizenship. They raged against the machine; they fought for the color line.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nFuturists foretell inevitable outcomes by conjuring up inevitable pasts. People who are in the business of selling predictions need to present the past as predictable—the ground truth, the test case. Machines are more predictable than people, and in histories written by futurists the machines just keep coming; depicting their march as unstoppable certifies the futurists’ predictions. But machines don’t just keep coming. They are funded, invented, built, sold, bought, and used by people who could just as easily not fund, invent, build, sell, buy, and use them. Machines don’t drive history; people do. History is not a smart car.\n\nIn “[Temp: How American Work, American Business, and the American Dream Became Temporary](https://www.amazon.com/Temp-American-Business-Became-Temporary/dp/0735224072/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=Temp%3A+How+American+Work%2C+American+Business%2C+and+the+American+Dream+Became+Temporary&qid=1551109012&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull)” (Viking), the historian Louis Hyman argues that in the course of the past century management consultants, taking the wheel, reinvented work by making employers more like machines, turning work into the kind of thing that robots could do long before there were any robots able to do it. His story begins in the nineteen-twenties, with the rise of management consulting, and takes a turn in the fifties, with the first major wave of automation, a word coined in 1948\\. “Machines should be used instead of people whenever possible,” a staffer for the National Office Managers Association advised in 1952\\. To compete, workers had to become as flexible as machines: able to work on a task basis; ineligible for unions; free at night; willing to work any shift; requiring no health care or other benefits, not so much as a day off at Christmas; easy to hire; and easier to fire.\n\n“The rise of computers and the rise of temps went hand in hand,” Hyman writes. By 1958, Elmer Winter had founded Manpower, Inc., and companies all over the country had come to rely on the services of management consultants to trim their employment costs. Hyman argues, “Beginning in the midst of the postwar boom in the 1950s, American jobs were slowly remade from top to bottom: consultants supplanted executives at the top, temps replaced office workers in the middle, and day laborers pushed out union workers at the bottom. On every step of the ladder, work would become more insecure as it became more flexible.”\n\nGradually, Hyman says, “the key features of the postwar corporation—stable workforce, retained earnings, and minimized risk—became liabilities rather than assets.” Beginning in the nineteen-seventies, Harvard Business School’s Michael Porter introduced the logic underlying outsourcing. By the nineteen-eighties, corporations had to get “lean.” (I worked for Porter in those days, as a Manpower temp.) By the nineteen-nineties, they needed to “downsize.” If businesses exist not to make things and employ people but instead to maximize profits for investors, labor can be done by temps, by poorly paid workers in other countries, or by robots, whichever is cheapest.\n\nThe robots, though, were mainly for show. In the nineteen-eighties, Apple called its headquarters the Robot Factory. “To understand the electronics industry is simple: every time someone says ‘robot,’ simply picture a woman of color,” Hyman advises. One in five electronics companies used no automation at all, and the rest used very little. Seagate’s disk drives were assembled by women in Singapore. Hewlett-Packard hired so many temporary workers that it started its own temp agency. The most important technology in the electronics industry, as Hyman points out, was the fingernail.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5c6f02d1cc63602cef2e4152]||||||\n+++\n\nIn the nineteen-eighties, the sociologist Patricia Fernandez-Kelly conducted a study of the electronics and garment industries in Southern California. More than seventy per cent of the labor force was women of color, and more than seventy per cent of those women were Hispanic. In San Diego, Fernandez-Kelly interviewed a woman she called Fermina Calero (a pseudonym, to protect her from deportation). Calero was born in Mexico. In 1980, when she was twenty-one, she began working in Tijuana, soldering filaments of metal for sixty-five cents an hour. In 1983, Calero crossed into the United States, illegally, to work at Kaypro, the maker of the Kaypro II, a personal computer that briefly rivalled the Apple II. In the nineteen-sixties and seventies, Andrew Kay, the company’s founder, had hired management consultants to help him reimagine his labor force. In the eighties, when people speaking English responded to the company’s newspaper Help Wanted ads, they were told that there were no openings; when people speaking Spanish called, they were invited to apply. By the time Calero started working for Kaypro, its workforce consisted of seven hundred people, nearly all undocumented Mexican immigrants. The company’s general manager said, “They are reliable; they work hard; they don’t make trouble.” At Kaypro, Calero earned nearly five dollars an hour. When the Immigration and Naturalization Service raided the factory, she hid in a supply closet. She was not a robot.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn 1984, the year that Calero hid in a closet at Kaypro, computer scientists at the annual meeting of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence began warning about the coming of an “A.I. winter”: artificial intelligence had been overhyped by a credulous press and overfunded by incautious investors, and, given these wild and wide-eyed expectations, it had underdelivered. The hype was about to die down, and the funding to dry up. The A.I. winter lasted for years.\n\nSkeptics of the current robots-are-coming argument predict the arrival of another A.I. winter. “We have not moved a byte forward in understanding human intelligence,” Zia Chishti wrote in the _Financial Times_ last fall. “We have much faster computers, thanks to Moore’s law, but the underlying algorithms are mostly identical to those that powered machines 40 years ago.” That goes back to the time of the Kaypro.\n\nA lot has changed in those forty years, not least in the availability of enormous sets of data that artificial intelligences can use to study and learn. Still, the economist Robert J. Gordon is unconvinced that the robots are coming. In his 2016 book, “[The Rise and Fall of American Growth](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-American-Growth-Princeton/dp/0691175802/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Rise+and+Fall+of+American+Growth&qid=1551109043&s=books&sr=1-1),” he argued that a century of economic expansion that began in 1870—driven by human-condition changing developments like electricity, a public water supply, and the interstate-highway system—ended in 1970, and that, since then, inventions have been merely incremental. The telephone was patented in 1876\\. It changed people’s lives, and contributed to a huge rise in productivity. The cell phone, Gordon argues, just isn’t that different from a telephone. In a 2016 essay, “[Why Robots Will Not Decimate Human Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-robots-decimate-human-jobs-bob-gordon),” Gordon points out that the uses to which smartphones get put are “not a part of the market economy that creates jobs and pays wages.” Robots have altered manufacturing, he concedes, but he doesn’t think that they’ve altered the economy, or that they’re about to. “I play a game called ‘find the robot,’ ” he writes. “In my daily strolls in and out of supermarkets, restaurants, doctor and dentist offices, my nearby hospital, offices in my own university, and the vast amount of employment involving elementary and secondary teachers, personal trainers, and old age caretakers, I have yet to find a robot.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nStill, even if the hype about robots is mostly unwarranted, the worry about jobs is real. If the latest jobs numbers look good, the longer-term trends look bad, especially for Americans without a high-school diploma, or less, a population whose real wages have been falling for decades. In a downward compression of the labor market, these jobs have been taken not so much by robots as by college graduates: as much as forty per cent of college graduates are currently working at jobs that do not require a college degree, Ellen Ruppel Shell reports, in “[The Job: Work and Its Future in a Time of Radical Change](https://www.amazon.com/Job-Work-Future-Radical-Change/dp/0451497252/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Job%3A+Work+and+Its+Future+in+a+Time+of+Radical+Change&qid=1551109109&s=books&sr=1-1-catcorr)” (Currency). Four out of every five children born in the United States in 1950 went on to earn more than their parents. For children born in 1980, that ratio had fallen to one in two. Lately, it’s down to one in three. Estimates range from the cautious to the entirely hysterical, but one reasonable study predicts that, by 2050, one in four working-age American men will be unemployed, having been replaced by some form of automation. Most imminently threatened are the millions of people who work as drivers of cars and trucks, scheduled to be replaced by fleets of self-driving vehicles beginning as early as next year.\n\nEconomic inequality produces political instability and partisan death matches. Everyone worries about jobs, but people who worry about robots and people who worry about immigrants propose very different solutions. Either way, much writing in this field is, essentially, fantasy. In “The Globotics Upheaval,” Baldwin predicts that the march of the robots will have four stages: transformation, upheaval, backlash, and resolution. The resolution will involve what he calls “shelterism.” Once white-collar workers realize that their jobs are on the line, too, they’ll find ways to protect themselves by “sheltering” certain activities, things that only humans can do. He explains, “This will mean that our work lives will be filled with far more caring, sharing, understanding, creating, empathizing, innovating, and managing people who are actually in the same room. This is a logical inevitability—everything else will be done by globots.” The catch is that, historically, caring, sharing, understanding, and empathizing with people who are in the same room as you has been the work of women, and is therefore either unpaid, and not recognized as work, or paid very badly. Childcare, elementary-school teaching, nursing, geriatric care, and social work will not suddenly become high-paying, high-prestige professions simply because everything else is done by robots. If that were going to happen, it would already be happening, because we already know that these jobs require beings who are human. Instead, something darker is going on, mirrored in the feminizing of robots, from the male robots of the nineteen-sixties and seventies—Hal, R2-D2, C-3PO, and Mr. Robinson’s robot on “Lost in Space”—to the fembots and sexbots of “Her” and “Ex Machina,” and, not least, the sexy and slavish Alexa. Female workers aren’t being paid more for being human; instead, robots are selling better when they’re female.\n\nThe economist Oren Cass, the author of “[The Once and Future Worker: A Vision for the Renewal of Work in America](https://www.amazon.com/Once-Future-Worker-Renewal-America/dp/1641770147/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=The+Once+and+Future+Worker%3A+A+Vision+for+the+Renewal+of+Work+in+America&qid=1551109128&s=books&sr=1-1-fkmrnull)” (Encounter), much of which originally appeared in _National Review_, is fed up with the robot hysteria. “Technological innovation and automation have always been integral to our economic progress, and in a well-functioning labor market, they should produce gains for all types of workers,” he insists. He has no patience with advocates of universal basic income, either. “We have reached a point where the rich think paying everyone else to go away represents compassionate thinking,” he writes.\n\nLike Hyman, Cass blames mid-twentieth-century economic thinkers for the current malaise, though he blames different thinkers. In the middle decades of the twentieth century, he argues, economic policymakers abandoned workers and the health of the labor market in favor of a commitment to over-all economic growth, with redistribution as an adjustment and consumerism as its objective. That required quantifying prosperity, hence the G.D.P., a measure that Cass, along with other writers, finds to be disastrous, not least because it values consumers above producers. Cass sees universal basic income as the end-stage scenario of every other redistribution program, whose justification is that the poor will be fine without work as long as they can buy things. Here he mocks the advocates of the current economic arrangement, who are prone to note that the poor are not actually starving, “and so many people have iPhones!”\n\nReporters are suckers for the hype, Cass maintains, pointing out that after a 2017 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research suggested that, in the next hundred years, robots might eliminate as many manufacturing jobs as were lost in 2001 (presumably, a tolerable loss), the _Times_ ran a story with the headline “*Evidence That Robots Are Winning the Race for American Jobs*{: .small},” while the Washington _Post_ titled its story “*We’re So Unprepared for the Robot Apocalypse*{: .small}.” Cass offers a careful criticism of the robots-are-stealing-our-jobs theory. He cites four of its errors. It overestimates twenty-first-century innovations and underestimates the innovations of earlier centuries. It miscalculates the pace of change. It assumes that automation will not create new sectors. (3-D printing might replace a lot of manufacturing workers, but it could also create a lot of new small businesses.) And it fails to appreciate the complexity of many of the jobs it thinks robots can do. The 2013 Oxford study that kept Andrés Oppenheimer up at night Cass finds to be mostly silly. Its authors, Carl Frey and Michael Osborne, rated seven hundred and two occupations from least “computerizable” to most. Highly vulnerable are school-bus drivers, and, while a self-driving school bus does not seem technically too far off, Cass points out, few parents can imagine putting their kids on a bus without a grownup to make sure they don’t bash one another the whole way to school.\n\nCass’s own policy proposals center, very reasonably, on the importance of work and family, but he fails to demonstrate how his proposals—lowering environmental regulations and establishing academic tracking in high schools—will achieve his objectives. And though “The Once and Future Worker” offers a rousing call for an honest reckoning with American economic policy, it also indulges in its own sleight of hand. “The story goes that ‘automation’ or the ‘knowledge economy,’ not bad public policy, is to blame,” Cass writes. “Historically, economists and policy makers have led the effort to explain that technological innovation is good for workers throughout the economy, even as its ‘creative destruction’ causes dislocation for some. So why, suddenly, are they so eager to throw robots and programmers under the bus?” One answer might be that, given the current state of American political polarization, it’s either throw the robots under the bus or throw the immigrants. Cass, not surprisingly, advocates restricting immigration.\n\n-=-=-=\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) ran for President on a promise to create twenty-five million new jobs during the next decade. “My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before,” he said in September, 2016\\. Many economists mocked his plan, which included protecting American jobs by imposing tariffs on imports. _The Economist_ [announced](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2016/07/30/drawbridges-up) a new political fault line, not between left and right but between open and closed: “Welcome immigrants or keep them out? Open up to foreign trade or protect domestic industries? Embrace cultural change, or resist it?” [Barack Obama](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Barack%20Obama) was an opener. Openers tend to talk about robots. “The next wave of economic dislocation won’t come from overseas,” Obama said in his farewell address, in January, 2017, days before Trump’s Inauguration. “It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes many good, middle-class jobs obsolete.”\n\nTrump is a closer. Closers tend to talk about immigrants. Trump has tweeted the word “jobs” nearly six hundred times, but not once has he tweeted the words “robot,” “robots,” or “automation.” “We’re going to fight for every last American job,” he promised from the floor of a Boeing plant in South Carolina, weeks after taking office. “I don’t want companies leaving our country,” the new President said. “There will be a very substantial penalty to be paid when they fire their people and move to another country, make the products, and think that they are going to sell it back over what will soon be a very, very strong border.” That June, Boeing laid off nearly two hundred employees from the South Carolina plant, as part of a forty-per-cent reduction in its production of 777s. In 2017, the company laid off nearly six thousand workers.\n\nTrump’s Administration mocks fears of a robot invasion. Closers usually do. “I’m not worried at all,” Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said two years ago. Nevertheless, some think tankers suggested that Trump’s election was “secretly about automation.” And [a study](https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article-abstract/34/3/418/5047377) published last summer in the _Oxford Review of Economic Policy_—whose lead author, Carl Frey, is the same guy who made the list of the seven hundred and two most computerizable jobs—argues that the robot caravan got Trump elected. Measuring the density of robots and comparing them with election returns, Frey and his colleagues found that “electoral districts that became more exposed to automation during the years running up to the election were more likely to vote for Trump.” Indulging in a counterfactual, they suggest that a less steeply rising increase in exposure to robots would have tipped both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin toward voting for [Hillary Clinton](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/hillary-clinton). According to this line of thinking, Twitter bots and fake Facebook news didn’t elect Donald Trump, but robots really might have. Or maybe it was all the talk about the wall.\n\nHeads, the robots are coming! Accept the inevitability of near-universal unemployment! Tails, the Mexicans are coming! Close the borders! So far, the only other choice, aside from helplessly watching the rise of extremism, is to mint a new coin. Heat a forge. Smelt a blank. Engrave two dies. Put your blank in between them. Strike the whole thing with a hammer. Anyone can do it. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c9b2710c62d10815459","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Robots","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"robots"},{"id":"5c2e1c7922d4972cd5b8328f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Artificial Intelligence (A.I.)","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"artificial-intelligence-ai"},{"id":"5c2e1e0d81ab3335f580f312","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Automation","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"automation"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f2396212cbb9fc9a3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Jobs","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"jobs"},{"id":"5c2e6270a23f7a2cc1a7cb9d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"}],"sections":[{"id":"59112e62f8fa3e67faf0d229","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Technology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-technology"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909ffbc1c7a8e33fb390bc3","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jill Lepore, a staff writer, has been contributing to *The New Yorker* since 2005.

Rouse studies the worms and other small animals that inhabit the deep sea. He was organizing his microscopes, dissection supplies, and jars of deep-sea critters when he received a long-anticipated e-mail. \n\nIn the late two-thousands, Rouse and Eddie Kisfaludy, then an operations manager for Virgin Oceanic, had begun meeting with officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (*NOAA*{: .small}) and the city of San Diego to pitch an alternative approach to the disposal of dead whales. Often, whales that wash up on shore are hauled to landfills or pushed back into the water. Rouse and Kisfaludy wanted to tow one out to sea, sink it to the seafloor, and watch what happened. Whale falls, as marine biologists call such events, create pop-up habitats that may serve as stepping stones for organisms migrating from methane seeps or hydrothermal vents to other parts of the ocean. Precisely how this works, and which species colonize the carcass as it degrades, were open questions that Rouse hoped to answer. \n\nIn the e-mail, a biologist from *NOAA*{: .small} wrote that a large female fin whale had washed ashore four days previously, on the rocky beach at Point Loma, just west of downtown San Diego. The *NOAA*{: .small} team had already moved the carcass to the protected beaches of Mission Bay and performed a necropsy, concluding that the whale had been hit by a ship. Now they were ready to hand it over to Rouse: if he could mobilize the necessary resources on short notice, the whale was his to sink.\n\nRouse quickly met up with Kisfaludy to strategize. They needed a boat big enough to tow a sixty-foot, twenty-three-ton whale, so Kisfaludy leaned on a Newport-based friend, Chris Welsh, for the use of his large catamaran. To sink the carcass, they sourced five tons of rusty chains from Newport Harbor  and another two tons of iron shackles from  the Scripps scrap yard, in San Diego.  \n\nOn Thanksgiving morning, Welsh set out in his catamaran—rusty chains on board—and sailed south.  The next day, he met up with Rouse, Kisfaludy, and a growing group of intrigued friends at the dead whale.  It rested on the sand, immovable. At high tide, however, the carcass began to float, and the team made its move. They tied seven ropes around the whale’s tail and sailed west. Several hours passed. The weather was crisp and sunny, and there was little boat traffic. To Rouse’s surprise, the whale had attracted no scavengers, despite its exposed rolls of dark purple muscle draped in white, translucent fat. The team began to consider names for the whale. Someone suggested Rosebud, and it stuck.\n\nAt the drop zone, the team tied the ropes to the hunks of metal, then used the boat’s crane, normally used to launch submarines, to lower the weight into the water. After a few hours and a lot of splashing, all of it was deployed—but Rosebud bobbed on the surface, refusing to sink. Rouse noticed a large gas bubble gathering inside the whale’s throat. “We were struggling with what to do,” he recalled, by phone. They wondered if they could release the trapped gas by  stabbing holes in the carcass, but, Rouse said, “all we had was a kitchen knife attached to a stick.” Kisfaludy and Welsh, dispatched on a dinghy, tried to free the gas, with no success. Then the afternoon breeze picked up. As the swell grew, the whale rocked back and forth. Eventually, the bubble popped out of its mouth, along with a pile of guts. The team cheered, delighted and disgusted. Rosebud disappeared beneath the waves.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nRosebud had sunk just twelve nautical miles from San Diego, but, in deep-sea research, close and accessible are very different things. The whale had fallen to a depth of eight hundred and fifty metres—about half a mile. Most of the remotely operated vehicles, or R.O.V.s, capable of conducting  intricate operations at that depth are owned by oil companies; only a handful are available for scientific research. Such research expeditions can cost as much as fifty thousand dollars a day, and securing that much funding and ship time can take years. Rouse’s approach had been to sink Rosebud first and hope that scientists would find a way to visit it in the future. \n\nIn 2012, [Paul Allen](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-rare-humanism-behind-paul-allens-technological-vision)’s superyacht, Octopus, conducted some initial reconnaissance. In 2013, Rouse participated in an expedition mounted by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (*MBARI*{: .small}) to study animal and microbe dispersal patterns at Rosebud and other nearby habitats.  \n\nIn the middle of 2014, Rouse joined another *MBARI*{: .small} expedition. (In total, there have been five expeditions to Rosebud.) At the time, I was a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology, studying the microbial activity around methane seeps. Whale falls and methane seeps can support similar flavors of microbes; I jumped at the chance to come along.\n\nOn a breezy June morning, we set out aboard the Western Flyer, a boxy white ship run with the no-frills efficiency of a floating industrial platform. As we lurched out of San Diego, I frantically set up a shipboard lab, preparing chemicals and sampling jars. By the time we reached Rosebud’s location, the wind had risen and the seas had grown choppy. Belowdecks, the cresting waves reverberated between the twin hulls. Using a compact crane, engineers lowered the jeep-sized R.O.V. into the moon pool, an opening in the deck that offers entry into the water.\n\nI pinballed through the narrow corridor to the control center to watch the descent. As my eyes adjusted to the dark room, I saw that it was illuminated by a wall of about a dozen screens: one showed a tense World Cup match between Italy and Costa Rica, while the rest contained camera views from the R.O.V.—shades of blue fading to the black of the deep sea. Eventually, the R.O.V.’s lights illuminated a uniform brown plain punctuated by occasional red rockfish. The camera began to move across the seafloor toward Rosebud.\n\nWe knew, broadly, what had happened in the preceding three years. For denizens of the seafloor, a whale fall is like a Las Vegas buffet—an improbable bounty in the middle of the desert. Rosebud had delivered about a thousand years’ worth of food in one fell swoop. The first animals to pounce had been scavengers, such as sleeper sharks and slimy, snake-like hagfish. In the course of about six months, they had eaten most of the skin and muscle. Inevitably, the scavengers had scattered pieces of flesh around the whale carcass, and native microbes had multiplied quickly around those scraps. Their feeding frenzy, in turn, had depleted oxygen in the seafloor’s top layers, creating niches for microbes that could make methane or breathe sulfate. \n\nAs Rosebud came into view, we saw colorful microbial carpets light up the screens—plush white, yellow, and orange mats, each a community of microbes precisely tuned to their chemical milieu. The whale’s towering rib cage had become a cathedral for worms, snails, and crabs, which grazed beneath its buttresses. A few hungry hagfish slithered through the skull’s eye sockets. When the cameras zoomed in, we saw that the bones were covered in red splotches. Rouse leapt from his chair and rushed to the monitors for a closer look: he suspected that the red tufts were colonies of remarkable bone-eating worms called *Osedax*, which had only just recently been described in a rigorous scientific study.\n\nSeveral hours later, the R.O.V. returned and was strapped to the deck. It had collected bone fragments, *Osedax* worms, and sediment cores. Kneeling next to a mud-draped robotic arm, I pushed rubber stoppers into tubes, then gingerly carried each sample to the lab, avoiding sudden movements to keep the sedimentary layers intact. The samples reeked of sulfur and decaying flesh. Staring down the eyepiece of a microscope, Rouse carefully extracted worms from bone fragments. Early the next morning, he was already back at it, tweezers in hand.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nWhale falls may occur as frequently as every ten miles on the seafloor; at any given time, there are likely hundreds of thousands of them around the world. A 2015 review paper by the deep-sea ecologist Craig Smith, at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and a number of collaborators proposed that decaying whale carcasses may serve “as a sort of biodiversity generator,” allowing organisms from different energy-rich seafloor oases, such as thermal vents or methane seeps, to mingle. The importance of these deep-sea ecosystems makes whale falls especially fascinating. Seafloor microbes consume methane, which is a greenhouse gas, and provide biomass that ultimately sustains fish populations. Rouse’s team is monitoring a number of habitats around Rosebud to understand how they’re connected, and how deep-sea oases like whale falls and seeps might drive evolution.\n\nThere are creatures that have been observed at whale falls and nowhere else. *Osedax* are among them. Shana Goffredi, a biologist at Occidental College, was part of the team that first analyzed the *Osedax* worm in detail, at a whale fall in Monterey Canyon, around four hundred miles northwest of San Diego. Since then, she has led several research projects to piece together the worm’s genetic heritage and bizarre way of life. The first scavengers at a whale fall feast on the flesh. “Anything could take advantage of that,” Goffredi told me, dismissively. *Osedax*—Latin for “bone-eater”—“are specifically relying on bone, which is a weird, weird thing to eat.”\n\n*Osedax* are strange organisms. Their free-floating larvae latch onto a bone’s outer layers, sifting through the water for a specific type of bacteria, *Oceanospirillales,* which they cultivate inside their bodies. Like the tube worms that are found at hydrothermal vents, *Osedax* have no mouth and no gut; their symbiotic partners are essential to their survival. While still unclear, it’s thought that the enzymes made by the *Oceanospirillales* bacteria could degrade collagen and cholesterol inside the bone, providing nutrition for themselves as well as their host worms. Beyond *Osedax*, scientists are discovering more species found exclusively on whale carcasses. These include bacteria-grazing scale worms and bone-eating snails—creatures whose ingenious inter-organism partnerships equip them to extract energy from rock-hard bone.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#image: /photos/5c704b7c37f85a2b950d590d]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\nThe appearance of *Osedax* wasn’t good news for Rosebud’s long-term prospects: “They accelerate the degradation of the whale,” Goffredi said. “They’re essentially undermining their own substrate—moving through it, acidifying it—and so they eat themselves out of a home. But it makes sense, since they have such an ephemeral existence. They live fast, die young. They’ve just got to crank.” \n\nStill, in 2018, when I visited Rosebud for a second time, the skeleton was surprisingly intact. Around a dozen researchers were aboard the research vessel Falkor as a part of the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s Backyard Deep expedition, which aimed to explore some of Southern California’s chemically driven deep-sea ecosystems. This time, in addition to watching the video feed from the R.O.V., we awkwardly narrated the proceedings for a live-streaming audience. When Rosebud’s hulking eye sockets came into view, I was relieved to find her reclining, stalwart, right where we’d left her. But, like a distant friend, she had changed. The dead-eyed hagfish were gone; so were the vibrant orange and yellow microbial mats. Only a thin white dusting remained—a reminder of the good times.\n\nOn Rosebud’s bones, *Osedax* and other segmented worms crawled lethargically, their slimy residue forming black, crisscrossing tubes. The R.O.V.’s pilots used its robotic arms to collect a vertebral disk; later, in the Falkor’s lab, members of Rouse’s team picked critters from the bones while the lights of San Diego shone in the distance.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nHow long can a whale fall endure before it disappears? Eventually, creatures like *Osedax* will destroy most of the skeleton. In a process called sedimentation, particles sinking through the water will bury anything that remains. While studying whale falls in Monterey Canyon, Rouse and his colleagues expected that the oasis around a typical carcass might persist for a couple of decades, but Rouse also came to believe that some could disappear over a much shorter or longer period of time. He thinks that a lower rate of sedimentation in Rosebud’s particular patch of seafloor, coupled with a seemingly sluggish excavation by *Osedax*, might mean that it could take half a century or more before all traces of Rosebud fade.\n\nCurrently, there are no specific plans to visit Rosebud, but Rouse is confident that something will materialize. (Many biologists are keen to make the trip.) In the meantime, when they were last seen, Rosebud’s vertebrae formed sharp promontories above the seafloor. Though only a few feet tall, they’re likely the highest points for miles around. Fluffy pink anemones swayed at their peaks, presaging the whale’s future as a reef—a place where animals and corals can bathe in the currents, catching food as it drifts through. \n\n*Danyoung Kim contributed reporting to this post.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d9aee7fe02cbd163441","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Marine Biology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"marine-biology"},{"id":"5c2e1cde22d4972cd5b83306","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Whales","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"whales"},{"id":"5c2e1c7836cecf40192141c5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"}],"sections":[{"id":"596e656cd1f51261132e868e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elements","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elements"}]},"channel":"Science","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5c66eda06840e27aad335674","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","email":"","name":"Jeffrey Marlow","socialMedia":[],"title":"Jeffrey Marlow is a geobiologist at Harvard University, where he studies complex microbial communities in extreme environments.

It quickly became apparent that he knew less about the subject than I did; he saved Facebook posts by painstakingly copying and pasting them into Word, comment by comment, and manually pressing print. The longer we spoke, the more visibly annoyed he grew by my questions, to which he offered no answers. He leaned farther and farther back in his chair and gazed over my left shoulder. Finally, he launched into a story about his senior year of college, when he wrote his thesis on an ill-defined topic and slowly realized that he’d bitten off more than he could chew. At first, I nodded politely, not understanding how this related to anything. Then the intent of the anecdote flooded through me on a tide of adrenaline, and I moved my notepad to my lap so that he couldn’t see my hand shaking with rage.\n\nOutside of the library, I stood in the cold and waited for my heart rate to return to normal. I wondered if the archivist was right that I was a naïve girl with inchoate ideas. Then I asked myself what gave him the power to make me wonder. Until then, I’d endured male condescension as if it couldn’t touch me, observing my small humiliations, across years in the workplace, from the other side of a cool pane of glass. But the barrage of #MeToo stories had stirred the sediment from those experiences, revealing that my self-regard had always been porous. The meeting with the archivist was barely a #MeToo moment—it was not sexual assault or harassment but rather a familiar kind of gendered belittlement. Still, it was the moment when #MeToo fully reached me.\n\nWhen I consider why I feel compelled to publish this story—so small, and so many months after the fact—I arrive at the answer that I want to contribute, however meagrely, to the record of what it was like to live through that fall. The notion that the memory of #MeToo needs preserving—both because it matters and because it could disappear—is also the premise of a much larger archival effort. In June, the Schlesinger Library at Harvard University’s Radcliffe Institute, arguably the paramount repository of works on American feminism, announced its intention to collect the millions of tweets and hundreds of thousands of Web pages—news articles, legislation, changing H.R. policies, public apologies—that composed #MeToo and remain as its evidence. (Harvard faculty members of the steering committee for the #MeToo project include [Jill Lepore](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jill-lepore), a staff writer for this magazine, and [Jeannie Suk Gersen](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jeannie-suk), a contributing writer.)\n\nThe undertaking has few major precedents. Only in the past decade have historians recognized the value of social media and libraries [begun building tools to collect it at scale](https://harpers.org/archive/2018/12/preservation-acts-archiving-twitter-social-media-movements/). (For seven years, starting in 2010, the Library of Congress vacuumed up every tweet, but that archive remains closed to researchers.) The Schlesinger has had to locate its own answers to a battery of technical and ethical questions as it prepares to allow access to its holdings, at least in part, by late 2019\\. For example, many of the women and men who shared #MeToo stories may have thought of them as ephemeral; they didn’t anticipate that they could become fodder for future theories of history. It’s a thorny dilemma but one that the library has no hope of solving if it doesn’t gather the posts before they disappear. “The argument is always in favor of preservation and against loss,” Jane Kamensky, the Schlesinger director and a Harvard history professor, told me. “As a historian, I believe we only understand things through primary evidence. Anything that stays dark is not going to be understood.”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nI met with Kamensky and her team in January, in temporary offices a few blocks from the Radcliffe Quadrangle (where the library is undergoing renovation), for [a virtual tour of what they’ve collected so far](https://www.schlesinger-metooproject-radcliffe.org/). She said that she hopes the data will go some way toward answering essential questions about #MeToo: What, if anything, has it accomplished? Was #MeToo a burst of revolutionary energy that has since flamed out, or is it a still-growing constellation of attempts to organize? Amanda Strauss, the special projects manager at the Schlesinger, said that their Twitter searches for #MeToo and related hashtags have continued to yield around a hundred and fifty thousand tweets every week, leaving them unsure about when to impose a temporal boundary on the archive—or where, in hindsight, historians will locate the end of #MeToo.\n\nThe archivists use a tool, created at George Washington University and called [Social Feed Manager](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/sfm-ui/about/overview), to perform weekly downloads of roughly fifty hashtags, which capture both trending conversations (#MuteRKelly) and sector-specific ones (#MeTooMedicine, #TimesUpTech), and also the parallel universe of counter-denunciations that collect under banners like #MeTooLiars and #IStandWithBrett. On the day of my visit, they scrolled through the latest haul of tweets from the evangelical #[ChurchToo](https://www.newyorker.com/news/on-religion/silence-is-not-spiritual-the-evangelical-metoo-movement) movement to demonstrate how the app creates spreadsheets of the posts’ metadata (information such as the number of retweets, the number of followers, and geolocation, if user-enabled). Twitter’s A.P.I. permits this kind of free mass download for the first week or so after a post appears on the Web, and the library is working with the company to purchase the nearly nineteen million tweets from the first year of the hashtags’ use.\n\nOther social-media sites present greater challenges: the Schlesinger can crawl individual Facebook and Instagram pages with a tool called the [Webrecorder](https://webrecorder.io/), but collecting them at scale is notoriously difficult. (Strauss told me that the issue of archiving these platforms more extensively is temporarily “on hold.”) The staff had planned to choose news articles and other URLs by hand before realizing that they needed to rethink their reach. Now they’re using [Media Cloud](https://mediacloud.org/), a tool developed by faculty members at M.I.T. and Harvard, to run vast searches of news stories that they can archive en masse.\n\nAs Jill Lepore has [written in *The New Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb), most people assume that the Web’s contents will be with us forever. (“Don’t post that picture if you don’t want it to follow you!”) In fact, the Internet is among our most ephemeral inventions: a piece of paper can survive for seven hundred years, but “the average life of a Web page is about a hundred days,” she wrote. To Strauss, collecting #MeToo feels “like we’re in the middle of a ticker-tape parade, and this content is raining down around us, and we need to pick it up or it’s going to get swept up and put in the trash.” So far, the vulnerable sites shored up on Harvard’s servers include a Medium [post about sexual harassment in the children’s-book industry](https://medium.com/@anneursu_10179/sexual-harassment-in-the-childrens-book-industry-3417048ccde2), a whisper-network-sourced [accounting of abuses in *STEM*{:.small}](https://metoostem.com/stories/), and a hyper-local news service’s [investigation of the California state legislature](https://calmatters.org/articles/blog/track-the-legislatures-sexual-harassment-records-with-our-spreadsheet/). Ultimately, the collection will reach back to 2006, when the activist Tarana Burke began campaigning against sexual assault using the slogan “me too.”\n\nThe Schlesinger staff’s choices shape the archive to a degree that’s unusual, and a little unwelcome. Standard collections have implicit boundaries: they’re the papers of a person or an organization or perhaps the surviving documentation of a single event, such as the March for Life. But #MeToo—which drew strength from millions of sources and exerted influence in every direction—can only be captured in what archivists call a “constructed” or “artificial” collection, an assemblage of objects of disparate provenance, with borders that are imposed, not absolute. The Schlesinger has other constructed collections, such as a survey of early women’s blogs, but the #MeToo project is by far the most ambitious. It pushes the library to the edge of its traditional role in a field that draws a stark line between archivists, who leave as few fingerprints as possible, and scholars, who mold history from the assembled clay.\n\n“It’s not the job of the archivist or librarian to try to answer questions like ‘Is #MeToo a movement?’ or impose our own conceptual framework on this material,” Jane Kelly, the Web-archiving assistant who harvests the bulk of the actual posts and pages, said. “My interpretation is a moot point.” But in this case the collectors can’t help but be curators, judging where #MeToo ends and where every other discussion of women, work, harassment, and violence begins.\n\nSome Internet preservationists have been pushing brick-and-mortar libraries to embrace this evolution. “Traditional archivists seem most comfortable dealing with the outcomes of the work of various types of documenters,” Clifford Lynch, the director of the Coalition for Networked Information, [wrote in an influential 2017 paper](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/8097/6583). But the Internet is more like “a nearly infinite number of unique, individual, personalized performances”—a new one every time you log on—than it is an assortment of artifacts. Lynch warns, “If archivists will not *create, capture, curate* the ‘Age of Algorithms,’ then we must quickly figure out who will undertake this task.”\n\nThe #MeToo project is one step in this direction, and it’s fitting that it occurs in the service of feminist history. Feminism’s contributions include a heightened awareness of history as a construct, its shape determined by what it leaves out. In [her famous poem](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/diving-wreck) “Diving Into the Wreck,” Adrienne Rich, whose papers the Schlesinger holds, envisions the legacy of women’s lives as a hulk left to decay beneath the surface of the official past. She imagines herself swimming down “to see the damage that was done / and the treasures that prevail&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;the wreck and not the story of the wreck.” Survivors used #MeToo to dredge their experiences for inclusion in history. The archive of their efforts will tacitly acknowledge, by way of its construction, that no record is ever objective or complete.\n\n-=-=-=-\nAnother theme of feminist scholarship, and of #MeToo, is women’s agency: telling your own story on your own terms. In the archive, this principle competes with the belief that the stories are worth saving. It’s impossible to ask the individuals behind millions of Twitter accounts for permission to preserve their words, and, legally speaking, it’s also unnecessary under the company’s user agreement. Twitter says that account holders own their tweets, but the fine print reveals that they don’t control them: in [a recent survey](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2056305118763366) of two hundred and sixty-eight Twitter users, almost half were under the mistaken impression that their tweets couldn’t be gathered for research without their express consent.\n\nAt the Schlesinger, these concerns are shaping conversations about which parts of the archive will be accessible to researchers, and when. The library could choose to share Twitter data from verified accounts, or accounts that reach a certain threshold number of followers, under the assumption that they had little expectation of privacy. In theory, it could allow keyword searches in which a researcher “asks the data a question and gets back an answer,” Kelly said, even as the actual tweets remain out of sight. The library quite possibly *would* remove content from view of the researchers—though not from the collection—if petitioned by its author. And the staff has considered the possibility that parts of the collection could be requested in the course of ongoing #MeToo litigation.  \n\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n\nUltimately, the archivists view their work as a service to researchers far removed from these skirmishes. “Time solves the problem as long as the material is collected and maintained,” Kamensky told me. “Our horizon is very long, so if something needs to be closed for the life of the author, it can be.” Harvard, in accordance with federal law, embargoes student records for eighty years, for example. “I often shock students by telling them that’s an actuarial assumption about when they’ll be dead.” And while collections often place restrictions on access in consultation with donors, the archivists hope to make most of the material accessible as soon as possible.\n\nStill, it may take a long time to discern what #MeToo meant, a question that waits to be answered by what happens next. For me, the collection is a comfort, preserving the future’s ability to know what we don’t—to examine in daylight our record of travelling the undersea deep. I wish that I could see the present through the eyes of that someday, or even that I knew what I would do if I met that male archivist who belittled me now. Would I tell him that I’m good at my job, which he doesn’t seem to be—or would his condescension still have a hold on me? Would I even get angry, or would I just keep abjectly nodding, observing the insult from my old, practiced remove? If you’re reading this in the future (unlikely, but anyway), I wonder: Does my story make sense to you? I suspect it may sound familiar, but I hope not.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"#MeToo","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"metoo"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"#MeToo","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"metoo"},{"id":"5c2e1ca622d4972cd5b832c3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1ca622d4972cd5b832c3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Libraries","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"libraries"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Libraries","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"libraries"},{"id":"5c2e1f3c41c92e2c9b85dc63","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1f3c41c92e2c9b85dc63","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Archivists","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"archivists"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Archivists","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"archivists"},{"id":"5c2e1c83e56e652c90274671","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c83e56e652c90274671","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Social

Not much more than three hours later, the plane, a Boeing 777, crashed in a field outside Donetsk, Ukraine. All two hundred and ninety-eight people on board were killed. The plane’s last radio contact was at 1:20 *P.M.*{: .small} G.M.T. At 2:50 *P.M.*{: .small} G.M.T., Igor Girkin, a Ukrainian separatist leader also known as Strelkov, or someone acting on his behalf, posted a message on VKontakte, a Russian social-media site: “We just downed a plane, an AN-26.” (An Antonov 26 is a Soviet-built military cargo plane.) The post includes links to video of the wreckage of a plane; it appears to be a Boeing 777.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo weeks before the crash, Anatol Shmelev, the curator of the Russia and Eurasia collection at the Hoover Institution, at Stanford, had submitted to the Internet Archive, a nonprofit library in California, a list of Ukrainian and Russian Web sites and blogs that ought to be recorded as part of the archive’s Ukraine Conflict collection. Shmelev is one of about a thousand librarians and archivists around the world who identify possible acquisitions for the Internet Archive’s subject collections, which are stored in its Wayback Machine, in San Francisco. Strelkov’s VKontakte page was on Shmelev’s list. “Strelkov is the field commander in Slaviansk and one of the most important figures in the conflict,” Shmelev had written in an e-mail to the Internet Archive on July 1st, and his page “deserves to be recorded twice a day.”\n\n\n\nOn July 17th, at 3:22 *P.M.*{: .small} G.M.T., the Wayback Machine saved a screenshot of Strelkov’s VKontakte post about downing a plane. Two hours and twenty-two minutes later, Arthur Bright, the Europe editor of the _Christian Science Monitor_, tweeted a picture of the screenshot, along with the message “Grab of Donetsk militant Strelkov’s claim of downing what appears to have been MH17.” By then, Strelkov’s VKontakte page had already been edited: the claim about shooting down a plane was deleted. The only real evidence of the original claim lies in the Wayback Machine.\n\n\n\nThe average life of a Web page is about a hundred days. Strelkov’s “We just downed a plane” post lasted barely two hours. It might seem, and it often feels, as though stuff on the Web lasts forever, for better and frequently for worse: the embarrassing photograph, the regretted blog (more usually regrettable not in the way the slaughter of civilians is regrettable but in the way that bad hair is regrettable). No one believes any longer, if anyone ever did, that “if it’s on the Web it must be true,” but a lot of people do believe that if it’s on the Web it will stay on the Web. Chances are, though, that it actually won’t. In 2006, David Cameron gave a speech in which he said that Google was democratizing the world, because “making more information available to more people” was providing “the power for anyone to hold to account those who in the past might have had a monopoly of power.” Seven years later, Britain’s Conservative Party scrubbed from its Web site ten years’ worth of Tory speeches, including that one. Last year, BuzzFeed deleted more than four thousand of its staff writers’ early posts, apparently because, as time passed, they looked stupider and stupider. Social media, public records, junk: in the end, everything goes.\n\n\n\nWeb pages don’t have to be deliberately deleted to disappear. Sites hosted by corporations tend to die with their hosts. When MySpace, GeoCities, and Friendster were reconfigured or sold, millions of accounts vanished. (Some of those companies may have notified users, but Jason Scott, who started an outfit called Archive Team—its motto is “We are going to rescue your shit”—says that such notification is usually purely notional: “They were sending e-mail to dead e-mail addresses, saying, ‘Hello, Arthur Dent, your house is going to be crushed.’ ”) Facebook has been around for only a decade; it won’t be around forever. Twitter is a rare case: it has arranged to archive all of its tweets at the Library of Congress. In 2010, after the announcement, Andy Borowitz tweeted, “Library of Congress to acquire entire Twitter archive—will rename itself Museum of Crap.” Not long after that, Borowitz abandoned that Twitter account. You might, one day, be able to find his old tweets at the Library of Congress, but not anytime soon: the Twitter Archive is not yet open for research. Meanwhile, on the Web, if you click on a link to Borowitz’s tweet about the Museum of Crap, you get this message: “Sorry, that page doesn’t exist!”\n\n\n\nThe Web dwells in a never-ending present. It is—elementally—ethereal, ephemeral, unstable, and unreliable. Sometimes when you try to visit a Web page what you see is an error message: “Page Not Found.” This is known as “link rot,” and it’s a drag, but it’s better than the alternative. More often, you see an updated Web page; most likely the original has been overwritten. (To overwrite, in computing, means to destroy old data by storing new data in their place; overwriting is an artifact of an era when computer storage was very expensive.) Or maybe the page has been moved and something else is where it used to be. This is known as “content drift,” and it’s more pernicious than an error message, because it’s impossible to tell that what you’re seeing isn’t what you went to look for: the overwriting, erasure, or moving of the original is invisible. For the law and for the courts, link rot and content drift, which are collectively known as “reference rot,” have been disastrous. In providing evidence, legal scholars, lawyers, and judges often cite Web pages in their footnotes; they expect that evidence to remain where they found it as their proof, the way that evidence on paper—in court records and books and law journals—remains where they found it, in libraries and courthouses. But a 2013 survey of law- and policy-related publications found that, at the end of six years, nearly fifty per cent of the URLs cited in those publications no longer worked. According to a 2014 study conducted at Harvard Law School, “more than 70% of the URLs within the Harvard Law Review and other journals, and 50% of the URLs within United States Supreme Court opinions, do not link to the originally cited information.” The overwriting, drifting, and rotting of the Web is no less catastrophic for engineers, scientists, and doctors. Last month, a team of digital library researchers based at Los Alamos National Laboratory reported the results of an exacting study of three and a half million scholarly articles published in science, technology, and medical journals between 1997 and 2012: one in five links provided in the notes suffers from reference rot. It’s like trying to stand on quicksand.\n\n\n\nThe footnote, a landmark in the history of civilization, took centuries to invent and to spread. It has taken mere years nearly to destroy. A footnote used to say, “Here is how I know this and where I found it.” A footnote that’s a link says, “Here is what I used to know and where I once found it, but chances are it’s not there anymore.” It doesn’t matter whether footnotes are your stock-in-trade. Everybody’s in a pinch. Citing a Web page as the source for something you know—using a URL as evidence—is ubiquitous. Many people find themselves doing it three or four times before breakfast and five times more before lunch. What happens when your evidence vanishes by dinnertime?\n\n\n\nThe day after Strelkov’s “We just downed a plane” post was deposited into the Wayback Machine, Samantha Power, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, told the U.N. Security Council, in New York, that Ukrainian separatist leaders had “boasted on social media about shooting down a plane, but later deleted these messages.” In San Francisco, the people who run the Wayback Machine posted on the Internet Archive’s Facebook page, “Here’s why we exist.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe address of the Internet Archive is archive.org, but another way to visit is to take a plane to San Francisco and ride in a cab to the Presidio, past cypresses that look as though someone had drawn them there with a smudgy crayon. At 300 Funston Avenue, climb a set of stone steps and knock on the brass door of a Greek Revival temple. You can’t miss it: it’s painted wedding-cake white and it’s got, out front, eight Corinthian columns and six marble urns.\n\n\n\n\n\n“We bought it because it matched our logo,” Brewster Kahle told me when I met him there, and he wasn’t kidding. Kahle is the founder of the Internet Archive and the inventor of the Wayback Machine. The logo of the Internet Archive is a white, pedimented Greek temple. When Kahle started the Internet Archive, in 1996, in his attic, he gave everyone working with him a book called “The Vanished Library,” about the burning of the Library of Alexandria. “The idea is to build the Library of Alexandria Two,” he told me. (The Hellenism goes further: there’s a partial backup of the Internet Archive in Alexandria, Egypt.) Kahle’s plan is to one-up the Greeks. The motto of the Internet Archive is “Universal Access to All Knowledge.” The Library of Alexandria was open only to the learned; the Internet Archive is open to everyone. In 2009, when the Fourth Church of Christ, Scientist, decided to sell its building, Kahle went to Funston Avenue to see it, and said, “That’s our logo!” He loves that the church’s cornerstone was laid in 1923: everything published in the United States before that date lies in the public domain. A temple built in copyright’s year zero seemed fated. Kahle hops, just slightly, in his shoes when he gets excited. He says, showing me the church, “It’s _Greek!_”\n\n\n\nKahle is long-armed and pink-cheeked and public-spirited; his hair is gray and frizzled. He wears round wire-rimmed eyeglasses, linen pants, and patterned button-down shirts. He looks like Mr. Micawber, if Mr. Micawber had left Dickens’s London in a time machine and landed in the Pacific, circa 1955, disguised as an American tourist. Instead, Kahle was born in New Jersey in 1960. When he was a kid, he watched “The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show”; it has a segment called “Peabody’s Improbable History,” which is where the Wayback Machine got its name. Mr. Peabody, a beagle who is also a Harvard graduate and a Nobel laureate, builds a *WABAC*{: .small} machine—it’s meant to sound like a *UNIVAC*{: .small}, one of the first commercial computers—and he uses it to take a boy named Sherman on adventures in time. “We just set it, turn it on, open the door, and there we are—or _were_, really,” Peabody says.\n\n\n\nWhen Kahle was growing up, some of the very same people who were building what would one day become the Internet were thinking about libraries. In 1961, in Cambridge, J. C. R. Licklider, a scientist at the technology firm Bolt, Beranek and Newman, began a two-year study on the future of the library, funded by the Ford Foundation and aided by a team of researchers that included Marvin Minsky, at M.I.T. As Licklider saw it, books were good at displaying information but bad at storing, organizing, and retrieving it. “We should be prepared to reject the schema of the physical book itself,” he argued, and to reject “the printed page as a long-term storage device.” The goal of the project was to imagine what libraries would be like in the year 2000. Licklider envisioned a library in which computers would replace books and form a “network in which every element of the fund of knowledge is connected to every other element.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/593b5f1120855957e69d53f1]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nIn 1963, Licklider became a director at the Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (now called *DARPA*{: .small}). During his first year, he wrote a seven-page memo in which he addressed his colleagues as “Members and Affiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network,” and proposed the networking of *ARPA*{: .small} machines. This sparked the imagination of an electrical engineer named Lawrence Roberts, who later went to *ARPA*{: .small} from M.I.T.’s Lincoln Laboratory. (Licklider had helped found both B.B.N. and Lincoln.) Licklider’s two-hundred-page Ford Foundation report, “Libraries of the Future,” was published in 1965. By then, the network he imagined was already being built, and the word “hyper-text” was being used. By 1969, relying on a data-transmission technology called “packet-switching” which had been developed by a Welsh scientist named Donald Davies, *ARPA*{: .small} had built a computer network called *ARPAnet*{: .small}. By the mid-nineteen-seventies, researchers across the country had developed a network of networks: an internetwork, or, later, an “internet.”\n\n\n\nKahle enrolled at M.I.T. in 1978. He studied computer science and engineering with Minsky. After graduating, in 1982, he worked for and started companies that were later sold for a great deal of money. In the late eighties, while working at Thinking Machines, he developed Wide Area Information Servers, or *WAIS*{: .small}, a protocol for searching, navigating, and publishing on the Internet. One feature of *WAIS*{: .small} was a time axis; it provided for archiving through version control. (Wikipedia has version control; from any page, you can click on a tab that says “View History” to see all earlier versions of that page.) *WAIS*{: .small} came before the Web, and was then overtaken by it. In 1989, at *CERN*{: .small}, the European Particle Physics Laboratory, in Geneva, Tim Berners-Lee, an English computer scientist, proposed a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) to link pages on what he called the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee toyed with the idea of a time axis for his protocol, too. One reason it was never developed was the preference for the most up-to-date information: a bias against obsolescence. But the chief reason was the premium placed on ease of use. “We were so young then, and the Web was so young,” Berners-Lee told me. “I was trying to get it to go. Preservation was not a priority. But we’re getting older now.” Other scientists involved in building the infrastructure of the Internet are getting older and more concerned, too. Vint Cerf, who worked on *ARPAnet*{: .small} in the seventies, and now holds the title of Chief Internet Evangelist at Google, has started talking about what he sees as a need for “digital vellum”: long-term storage. “I worry that the twenty-first century will become an informational black hole,” Cerf e-mailed me. But Kahle has been worried about this problem all along.\n\n\n\n“I’m completely in praise of what Tim Berners-Lee did,” Kahle told me, “but he kept it very, very simple.” The first Web page in the United States was created at *SLAC*{: .small}, Stanford’s linear-accelerator center, at the end of 1991. Berners-Lee’s protocol—which is not only usable but also elegant—spread fast, initially across universities and then into the public. “Emphasized text like *this*{: .blue} is a hypertext link,” a 1994 version of *SLAC*{: .small}’s Web page explained. In 1991, a ban on commercial traffic on the Internet was lifted. Then came Web browsers and e-commerce: both Netscape and Amazon were founded in 1994. The Internet as most people now know it—Web-based and commercial—began in the mid-nineties. Just as soon as it began, it started disappearing.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAnd the Internet Archive began collecting it. The Wayback Machine is a Web archive, a collection of old Web pages; it is, in fact, _the_ Web archive. There are others, but the Wayback Machine is so much bigger than all of them that it’s very nearly true that if it’s not in the Wayback Machine it doesn’t exist. The Wayback Machine is a robot. It crawls across the Internet, in the manner of Eric Carle’s very hungry caterpillar, attempting to make a copy of every Web page it can find every two months, though that rate varies. (It first crawled over this magazine’s home page, newyorker.com, in November, 1998, and since then has crawled the site nearly seven thousand times, lately at a rate of about six times a day.) The Internet Archive is also stocked with Web pages that are chosen by librarians, specialists like Anatol Shmelev, collecting in subject areas, through a service called Archive It, at archive-it.org, which also allows individuals and institutions to build their own archives. (A copy of everything they save goes into the Wayback Machine, too.) And anyone who wants to can preserve a Web page, at any time, by going to archive.org/web, typing in a URL, and clicking “Save Page Now.” (That’s how most of the twelve screenshots of Strelkov’s VKontakte page entered the Wayback Machine on the day the Malaysia Airlines flight was downed: seven captures that day were made by a robot; the rest were made by humans.)\n\n\n\n\n\nI was on a panel with Kahle a few years ago, discussing the relationship between material and digital archives. When I met him, I was struck by a story he told about how he once put the entire World Wide Web into a shipping container. He just wanted to see if it would fit. How big is the Web? It turns out, he said, that it’s twenty feet by eight feet by eight feet, or, at least, it was on the day he measured it. How much did it weigh? Twenty-six thousand pounds. He thought that _meant_ something. He thought people needed to _know_ that.\n\n\n\nKahle put the Web into a storage container, but most people measure digital data in bytes. This essay is about two hundred thousand bytes. A book is about a megabyte. A megabyte is a million bytes. A gigabyte is a billion bytes. A terabyte is a million million bytes. A petabyte is a million gigabytes. In the lobby of the Internet Archive, you can get a free bumper sticker that says “10,000,000,000,000,000 Bytes Archived.” Ten petabytes. It’s obsolete. That figure is from 2012. Since then, it’s doubled.\n\n\n\nThe Wayback Machine has archived more than four hundred and thirty billion Web pages. The Web is global, but, aside from the Internet Archive, a handful of fledgling commercial enterprises, and a growing number of university Web archives, most Web archives are run by national libraries. They collect chiefly what’s in their own domains (the Web Archive of the National Library of Sweden, for instance, includes every Web page that ends in “.se”). The Library of Congress has archived nine billion pages, the British Library six billion. Those collections, like the collections of most national libraries, are in one way or another dependent on the Wayback Machine; the majority also use Heritrix, the Internet Archive’s open-source code. The British Library and the Bibliothèque Nationale de France backfilled the early years of their collections by using the Internet Archive’s crawls of the .uk and .fr domains. The Library of Congress doesn’t actually do its own Web crawling; it contracts with the Internet Archive to do it instead.\n\n\n\nThe church at 300 Funston Avenue is twenty thousand square feet. The Internet Archive, the building, is open to the public most afternoons. It is, after all, a library. In addition to housing the Wayback Machine, the Internet Archive is a digital library, a vast collection of digitized books, films, television and radio programs, music, and other stuff. Because of copyright, not everything the Internet Archive has digitized is online. In the lobby of the church, there’s a scanning station and a listening room: two armchairs, a coffee table, a pair of bookshelves, two iPads, and two sets of headphones. “You can listen to anything here,” Kahle says. “We can’t put all our music on the Internet, but we can put everything here.”\n\n\n\nCopyright is the elephant in the archive. One reason the Library of Congress has a very small Web-page collection, compared with the Internet Archive, is that the Library of Congress generally does not collect a Web page without asking, or, at least, giving notice. “The Internet Archive hoovers,” Abbie Grotke, who runs the Library of Congress’s Web-archive team, says. “We can’t hoover, because we have to notify site owners and get permissions.” (There are some exceptions.) The Library of Congress has something like an opt-in policy; the Internet Archive has an opt-out policy. The Wayback Machine collects every Web page it can find, unless that page is blocked; blocking a Web crawler requires adding only a simple text file, “robots.txt,” to the root of a Web site. The Wayback Machine will honor that file and not crawl that site, and it will also, when it comes across a robots.txt, remove all past versions of that site. When the Conservative Party in Britain deleted ten years’ worth of speeches from its Web site, it also added a robots.txt, which meant that, the next time the Wayback Machine tried to crawl the site, all its captures of those speeches went away, too. (Some have since been restored.) In a story that ran in the _Guardian_, a Labour Party M.P. said, “It will take more than David Cameron pressing delete to make people forget about his broken promises.” And it would take more than a robots.txt to entirely destroy those speeches: they have also been collected in the U.K. Web Archive, at the British Library. The U.K. has what’s known as a legal-deposit law; it requires copies of everything published in Britain to be deposited in the British Library. In 2013, that law was revised to include everything published on the U.K. Web. “People put their private lives up there, and we actually don’t want that stuff,” Andy Jackson, the technical head of the U.K. Web Archive, told me. “We don’t want anything that you wouldn’t consider a publication.” It is hard to say quite where the line lies. But Britain’s legal-deposit laws mean that the British Library doesn’t have to honor a request to stop collecting.\n\n\n\nLegal-deposit laws have been the standard in Western Europe for centuries. They provide national libraries with a form of legal protection unavailable to the Library of Congress, which is not strictly a national library; also, U.S. legal- deposit laws have exempted online-only works. “We are citadels,” Gildas Illien, the former Web archivist at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, told me. The Internet Archive is an invaluable public institution, but it’s not a national library, either, and, because the law of copyright has not kept up with technological change, Kahle has been collecting Web sites and making them freely available to the public without the full and explicit protection of the law. “It’s extremely audacious,” Illien says. “In Europe, no organization, or very few, would take that risk.” There’s another feature to legal-deposit laws like those in France, a compromise between advocates of archiving and advocates of privacy. Archivists at the BnF can capture whatever Web pages they want, but those collections can be used only in the physical building itself. (For the same reason, you can’t check a book out of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France; you have to read it there.) One result is that the BnF’s Web archive is used by a handful of researchers, a few dozen a month; the Wayback Machine is used by hundreds of thousands of people a day.\n\n\n\nIn 2002, Kahle proposed an initiative in which the Internet Archive, in collaboration with national libraries, would become the head of a worldwide consortium of Web archives. (The Internet Archive collects from around the world, and is available in most of the world. Currently, the biggest exception is China—“I guess because we have materials on the archive that the Chinese government would rather not have its citizens see,” Kahle says.) This plan didn’t work out, but from that failure came the International Internet Preservation Consortium, founded in 2003 and chartered at the BnF. It started with a dozen member institutions; there are now forty-nine.\n\n\n\nSomething else came out of that consortium. I talked to Illien two days after the massacre in Paris at the offices of _Charlie Hebdo_. “We are overwhelmed, and scared, and even taking the subway is terrifying, and we are scared for our children,” Illien said. “The library is a target.” When we spoke, the suspects were still at large; hostages had been taken. Illien and his colleagues had started a Web archive about the massacre and the world’s response. “Right now the media is full of it, but we know that most of that won’t last,” he said. “We wrote to our colleagues around the world and asked them to send us feeds to these URLs, to Web sites that were happening, right now, in Paris, so that we could collect them and historians will one day be able to see.” He was very quiet. He said, “When something like that happens, you wonder what you can do from where you sit. Our job is memory.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/593b5f13ba20a654ac5d4462]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nThe plan to found a global Internet archive proved unworkable, partly because national laws relating to legal deposit, copyright, and privacy are impossible to reconcile, but also because Europeans tend to be suspicious of American organizations based in Silicon Valley ingesting their cultural inheritance. Illien told me that, when faced with Kahle’s proposal, “national libraries decided they could not rely on a third party,” even a nonprofit, “for such a fundamental heritage and preservation mission.” In this same spirit, and in response to Google Books, European libraries and museums collaborated to launch Europeana, a digital library, in 2008. The Googleplex, Google’s headquarters, is thirty-eight miles away from the Internet Archive, but the two could hardly be more different. In 2009, after the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers sued Google Books for copyright infringement, Kahle opposed the proposed settlement, charging Google with effectively attempting to privatize the public-library system. In 2010, he was on the founding steering committee of the Digital Public Library of America, which is something of an American version of Europeana; its mission is to make what’s in libraries, archives, and museums “freely available to the world . . . in the face of increasingly restrictive digital options.”\n\n\n\nKahle is a digital utopian attempting to stave off a digital dystopia. He views the Web as a giant library, and doesn’t think it ought to belong to a corporation, or that anyone should have to go through a portal owned by a corporation in order to read it. “We are building a library that is us,” he says, “and it is ours.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nWhen the Internet Archive bought the church, Kahle recalls, “we had the idea that we’d convert it into a library, but what does a library look like anymore? So we’ve been settling in, and figuring that out.”\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the lobby, we headed up a flight of yellow-carpeted stairs to the chapel, an enormous dome-ceilinged room filled with rows of oak pews. There are arched stained-glass windows, and the dome is a stained-glass window, too, open to the sky, like an eye of God. The chapel seats seven hundred people. The floor is sloped. “At first, we thought we’d flatten the floor and pull up the pews,” Kahle said, as he gestured around the room. “But we couldn’t. They’re just too beautiful.”\n\n\n\nOn the wall on either side of the altar, wooden slates display what, when this was a church, had been the listing of the day’s hymn numbers. The archivists of the Internet have changed those numbers. One hymn number was 314. “Do you know what that is?” Kahle asked. It was a test, and something of a trick question, like when someone asks you what’s your favorite B track on the White Album. “Pi,” I said, dutifully, or its first three digits, anyway. Another number was 42. Kahle gave me an inquiring look. I rolled my eyes. Seriously? But it is serious, in a way. It’s hard not to worry that the Wayback Machine will end up like the computer in Douglas Adams’s “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” which is asked what is the meaning of “life, the universe, and everything,” and, after thinking for millions of years, says, “Forty-two.” If the Internet can be archived, will it ever have anything to tell us? Honestly, isn’t most of the Web trash? And, if everything’s saved, won’t there be too much of it for anyone to make sense of any of it? Won’t it be useless?\n\n\n\nThe Wayback Machine is humongous, and getting humongouser. You can’t search it the way you can search the Web, because it’s too big and what’s in there isn’t sorted, or indexed, or catalogued in any of the many ways in which a paper archive is organized; it’s not ordered in any way at all, except by URL and by date. To use it, all you can do is type in a URL, and choose the date for it that you’d like to look at. It’s more like a phone book than like an archive. Also, it’s riddled with errors. One kind is created when the dead Web grabs content from the live Web, sometimes because Web archives often crawl different parts of the same page at different times: text in one year, photographs in another. In October, 2012, if you asked the Wayback Machine to show you what cnn.com looked like on September 3, 2008, it would have shown you a page featuring stories about the 2008 McCain-Obama Presidential race, but the advertisement alongside it would have been for the 2012 Romney-Obama debate. Another problem is that there is no equivalent to what, in a physical archive, is a perfect provenance. Last July, when the computer scientist Michael Nelson tweeted the archived screenshots of Strelkov’s page, a man in St. Petersburg tweeted back, “Yep. Perfect tool to produce ‘evidence’ of any kind.” Kahle is careful on this point. When asked to authenticate a screenshot, he says, “We can say, ‘This is what we know. This is what our records say. This is how we received this information, from which apparent Web site, at this IP address.’ But to actually say that this happened in the past is something that we can’t say, in an ontological way.” Nevertheless, screenshots from Web archives have held up in court, repeatedly. And, as Kahle points out, “They turn out to be much more trustworthy than most of what people try to base court decisions on.”\n\n\n\nYou can do something more like keyword searching in smaller subject collections, but nothing like Google searching (there is no relevance ranking, for instance), because the tools for doing anything meaningful with Web archives are years behind the tools for creating those archives. Doing research in a paper archive is to doing research in a Web archive as going to a fish market is to being thrown in the middle of an ocean; the only thing they have in common is that both involve fish.\n\n\n\nThe Web archivists at the British Library had the brilliant idea of bringing in a team of historians to see what they could do with the U.K. Web Archive; it wasn’t all that much, but it was helpful to see what they _tried_ to do, and why it didn’t work. Gareth Millward, a young scholar interested in the history of disability, wanted to trace the history of the Royal National Institute for the Blind. It turned out that the institute had endorsed a talking watch, and its name appeared in every advertisement for the watch. “This one advert appears thousands of times in the database,” Millward told me. It cluttered and bogged down nearly everything he attempted. Last year, the Internet Archive made an archive of its .gov domain, tidied up and compressed the data, and made it available to a group of scholars, who tried very hard to make something of the material. It was so difficult to recruit scholars to use the data that the project was mostly a wash. Kahle says, “I give it a B.” Stanford’s Web archivist, Nicholas Taylor, thinks it’s a chicken-and-egg problem. “We don’t know what tools to build, because no research has been done, but the research hasn’t been done because we haven’t built any tools.”\n\n\n\nThe footnote problem, though, stands a good chance of being fixed. Last year, a tool called Perma.cc was launched. It was developed by the Harvard Library Innovation Lab, and its founding supporters included more than sixty law-school libraries, along with the Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society, the Internet Archive, the Legal Information Preservation Alliance, and the Digital Public Library of America. Perma.cc promises “to create citation links that will never break.” It works something like the Wayback Machine’s “Save Page Now.” If you’re writing a scholarly paper and want to use a link in your footnotes, you can create an archived version of the page you’re linking to, a “permalink,” and anyone later reading your footnotes will, when clicking on that link, be brought to the permanently archived version. Perma.cc has already been adopted by law reviews and state courts; it’s only a matter of time before it’s universally adopted as the standard in legal, scientific, and scholarly citation.\n\n\n\nPerma.cc is a patch, an excellent patch. Herbert Van de Sompel, a Belgian computer scientist who works at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, is trying to reweave the fabric of the Web. It’s not possible to go back in time and rewrite the HTTP protocol, but Van de Sompel’s work involves adding to it. He and Michael Nelson are part of the team behind Memento, a protocol that you can use on Google Chrome as a Web extension, so that you can navigate from site to site, and from time to time. He told me, “Memento allows you to say, ‘I don’t want to see this link where it points me to today; I want to see it around the time that this page was written, for example.’ ” It searches not only the Wayback Machine but also every major public Web archive in the world, to find the page closest in time to the time you’d like to travel to. (“A world with one archive is a really bad idea,” Van de Sompel points out. “You need redundance.”) This month, the Memento group is launching a Web portal called Time Travel. Eventually, if Memento and projects like it work, the Web will have a time dimension, a way to get from now to then, effortlessly, a fourth dimension. And then the past will be inescapable, which is as terrifying as it is interesting.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAt the back of the chapel, up a short flight of stairs, there are two niches, arched alcoves the same shape and size as the stained-glass windows. Three towers of computers stand within each niche, and ten computers are stacked in each tower: black, rectangular, and humming. There are towers like this all over the building; these are only six of them. Still, this is _it_.\n\n\n\n\n\nKahle stands on his tiptoes, sinks back into his sneakers, and then bounds up the stairs. He is like a very sweet boy who, having built a very fine snowman, drags his mother outdoors to see it before it melts. I almost expect him to take my hand. I follow him up the stairs.\n\n\n\n“Think of them as open stacks,” he says, showing me the racks. “You can walk right up to them and touch them.” He reaches out and traces the edge of one of the racks with the tip of his index finger. “If you had all the words in every book in the Library of Congress, it would be about an inch, here,” he says, measuring the distance between his forefinger and thumb.\n\n\n\nUp close, they’re noisy. It’s mainly fans, cooling the machines. At first, the noise was a problem: a library is supposed to be quiet. Kahle had soundproofing built into the walls.\n\n\n\nEach unit has a yellow and a green light, glowing steadily: power indicators. Then, there are blue lights, flickering.\n\n\n\n“Every time a light blinks, someone is uploading or downloading,” Kahle explains. Six hundred thousand people use the Wayback Machine every day, conducting two thousand searches a second. “You can _see_ it.” He smiles as he watches. “They’re glowing books!” He waves his arms. “They glow when they’re being read!”\n\n\n\nOne day last summer, a missile was launched into the sky and a plane crashed in a field. “We just downed a plane,” a soldier told the world. People fell to the earth, their last passage. Somewhere, someone hit “Save Page Now.”\n\n\n\nWhere is the Internet’s memory, the history of our time?\n\n\n\n“It’s right _here!_” Kahle cries.\n\n\n\nThe machine hums and is muffled. It is sacred and profane. It is eradicable and unbearable. And it glows, against the dark. ♦","canonicalUrl":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59112e62f8fa3e67faf0d229","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Technology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-technology"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909ffbc1c7a8e33fb390bc3","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jill Lepore, a staff writer, has been contributing to *The New Yorker* since 2005.

Journalism has played a role in this. On October 10, 2017, *The New Yorker* published the [first in a series of articles](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories) by Ronan Farrow in which women brought allegations of rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment against the film executive Harvey Weinstein. (Weinstein denied that he had committed rape or sexual assault.) Farrow’s story came several days after a remarkable [story in the *Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html?_r=0), by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, reported allegations that Weinstein had sexually harassed multiple women and paid them for their silence. As interest in the accusations against Weinstein crested, the actress Alyssa Milano posted to Twitter, “If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet,” prompting thousands of women (and men) to reactivate a slogan that the activist Tarana Burke had coined in 2006\\. Almost instantly, #MeToo became shorthand for a decentralized campaign against gender-based violence and abuse. Weinstein was hardly the first powerful man to be investigated for disgraceful behavior toward women—Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly at Fox News preceded him—but Weinstein’s fall catalyzed the movement, and what followed has been a long line of prominent men in politics, media, show business, corporate leadership, and many other fields who have been called to account.\n\nTo mark a tumultuous year, we asked eight of our writers to look back on #MeToo in order to anticipate what could—or should—come next. As it happens, we gave them this assignment in the midst of the battle over [Brett Kavanaugh](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brett-kavanaugh)’s appointment to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh’s ascent to the nation’s highest court has only intensified the discussion of #MeToo, and is bound to play a critical role in the midterm elections next month. In this package, Jia Tolentino assesses the backlash against #MeToo, while Masha Gessen asks what real justice for victims could look like. Amanda Petrusich measures her own anger while also taking solace in the relative optimism of her students. Doreen St. Félix describes the movement’s need for a more flexible language. Helen Rosner sizes up the ongoing reckoning in the restaurant industry. Katy Waldman looks at the movement’s impact on the literary world. Han Zhang reports on how #MeToo spread via social media and chat apps in China, eluding government surveillance. And Allyson Hobbs writes about her own sexual assault and African-American traditions of testimony. Right now, many women and men are searching for rational answers to questions about the workplace, about justice, and about the ways in which we conduct our private lives. It is our wish that these pieces add something vital to that conversation.\n\n\n+++feature-small\n\n+++group-2\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5bbd1556742f932cbcb7aa46]|||\n[“What Women’s Speech Is Still Not Allowed to Do,” by Jia Tolentino](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/one-year-of-metoo-what-womens-speech-is-still-not-allowed-to-do)\n|||\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5bbce2408688f82d6d6684be]|||\n[“A Younger Generation’s Remedy for Rage,” by Amanda Petrusich](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/one-year-of-metoo-a-younger-generations-remedy-for-rage)\n|||\n\n\n+++\n\n+++group-2\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5bbd16cb15b2a12cf77d88aa]|||\n[“Punishing Individual Abusers Is Not the Same as Justice,” by Masha Gessen](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/one-year-of-metoo-punishing-individual-abusers-is-not-the-same-as-justice)\n|||\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5bbcf2080cdf452cf93ca1c4]|||\n[“We Need a More Flexible Language of Abuse and Victimhood,” by Doreen St. Felix](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/one-year-of-metoo-we-need-a-more-flexible-language-of-abuse-and-victimhood/)\n|||\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n+++group-2\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5bbcec701e40b62d6cc41443]|||\n[“How the Movement Eludes Government Surveillance in China,” by Han Zhang](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/one-year-of-metoo-how-the-movement-eludes-government-surveillance-in-china)\n|||\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5bbcedbd15b2a12cf77d87b6]|||\n[“A Modest Proposal to Help Stop Harassment in the Restaurant Industry,” by Helen Rosner](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/one-year-of-metoo-a-modest-proposal-to-help-dismantle-the-restaurant-industrys-culture-of-sexual-harassment)\n|||\n\n\n\n+++\n\n+++group-2\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5bbb7e62aaa2d82cf80e10ad]|||\n[“&nbsp;‘He Said, She Said’ Is a Literary Problem, Too,” by Katy Waldman](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/one-year-of-metoo-he-said-she-said-is-a-literary-problem-too)\n|||\n\n[#image: /photos/5bbcf6db72b4842cd218313c]|||\n[“The Legacy of Black Women’s Testimonies,” by Allyson Hobbs](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/one-year-of-metoo-the-legacy-of-black-womens-testimonies)\n|||\n+++\n\n+++","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"#MeToo","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"metoo"},{"id":"5c2e1d4c2710c62d10815518","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"One Year of #MeToo","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"one-year-of-metoo"},{"id":"5c2e1cc42bfcc72cd92d0595","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sexual Assault","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sexual-assault"},{"id":"5c2e1d5d397f5b30646d06eb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sexual Harassment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sexual-harassment"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f2710c62d10815419","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Harvey Weinstein","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"harvey-weinstein"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a02f72179605b11ad9967","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"David Remnick has been editor of *The New Yorker* since 1998 and a staff writer since 1992.

In 1988, he started a four-year tenure as a Washington *Post* Moscow correspondent, an experience that formed the basis of his 1993 book on the former Soviet Union, “[Lenin’s Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire](https://www.amazon.com/Lenins-Tomb-Last-Soviet-Empire/dp/0679751254).” In 1994, “Lenin’s Tomb” received both the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction and a George Polk Award for excellence in journalism.\n\nUnder Remnick’s leadership, *The New Yorker* has become the country’s most honored magazine. It has won forty-eight National Magazine Awards, including multiple citations for general excellence, and has been named a finalist a hundred and seventy-eight times, more than any other publication. In 2016, it became the first magazine to receive a Pulitzer Prize for its writing, and now has won four, including the gold medal for public service.

According to a recent [Harris/Axios](https://www.axios.com/facebook-reputation-drops-axios-harris-poll-0d6c406a-4c2e-463a-af98-1748d3e0ab9a.html) survey of the hundred most visible companies in the U.S., Facebook’s reputation has taken a precipitous dive in the last five years, with its most acute plunge in the past year, and it scores particularly low in the categories of citizenship, ethics, and trust.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg’s blog post can be read as a response to this loss of faith, it is also a strategic move to capitalize on [the social-media platform’s failures](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/facebooks-very-bad-month-just-got-worse). To be clear, what Zuckerberg calls “town square” Facebook, where people post updates about new jobs, and share prom pictures and erroneous information about vaccines, will continue to exist. (On Thursday, Facebook [announced](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/07/facebook-anti-vaxx-vaccine-hoax-ads) that it would ban anti-vaccine advertisements on the site.) His new vision is to create a separate product that merges Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram into an encrypted and interoperable communications platform that will be more like a “living room.” According to Zuckerberg, “We’ve worked hard to build privacy into all our products, including those for public sharing. But one great property of messaging services is that, even as your contacts list grows, your individual threads and groups remain private. As your friends evolve over time, messaging services evolve gracefully and remain intimate.”\n\nThis new Facebook promises to store data securely in the cloud, and delete messages after a set amount of time to reduce “the risk of your messages resurfacing and embarrassing you later.” (Apparently, Zuckerberg already uses this feature, as [Tech Crunch reported](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/zuckerberg-deleted-messages), in April, 2018.) Its interoperability means, for example, that users will be able to buy something from Facebook Marketplace and communicate with the seller via WhatsApp; Zuckerberg says this will enable the buyer to avoid sharing a phone number with a stranger. Just last week, however, [a user discovered](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-phone-number-that-secures-your-facebook-account-isnt-as-safe-as-you-think-2019-03-04) that phone numbers provided for two-factor authentication on Facebook can be used to track people across the Facebook universe. Zuckerberg does not address how the new product will handle this feature, since “town square” Facebook will continue to exist.\n\nOnce Facebook has merged all of its products, the company plans to build other products on top of it, including payment portals, banking services, and, not surprisingly, advertising. In an [interview with *Wired’s*](https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-privacy-pivot/) editor-in-chief, Nicholas Thompson, Zuckerberg explained that “What I’m trying to lay out is a privacy-focused vision for this kind of platform that starts with messaging and making that as secure as possible with end-to-end encryption, and then building all of the other kinds of private and intimate ways that you would want to interact—from calling, to groups, to stories, to payments, to different forms of commerce, to sharing location, to eventually having a more open-ended system to plug in different kinds of tools for providing the interaction with people in all the ways that you would want.” \n\nIf this sounds familiar, it is. Zuckerberg’s concept borrows liberally from WeChat, the multiverse Chinese social-networking platform, popularly known as China’s “[app for everything](https://the-parallax.com/2018/06/21/meet-wechat-everything-app-china/).” WeChat’s billion monthly active users employ the app for texting, video conferencing, broadcasting, money transfers, paying fines, and making medical appointments. Privacy, however, is not one of its attributes. According to a 2015 article in [*Quartz*](https://qz.com/518908/wechats-new-heat-map-feature-lets-users-and-chinese-authorities-see-where-crowds-are-forming/), WeChat’s “heat map” feature alerts Chinese authorities to unusual crowds of people, which the government can then surveil.\n\nZuckerberg is quick to point out that his vision for this new Facebook is aspirational. It has not yet been built, and it is not certain that it *can* be built—at least in the way he imagines it—with across-the-board encryption. “I believe the future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won’t stick around forever,” Zuckerberg tells us. “This is the future I hope we will help bring about.” By announcing it now, and framing it in terms of privacy, he appears to be addressing the concerns of both users and regulators, while failing to acknowledge that a consolidated Facebook will provide advertisers with an even richer and more easily accessed database of users than the site currently offers. As [*Wired* reported](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/facebook-whatsapp-merger) in January, when the merger of Facebook’s apps was floated in the press, “the move will unlock huge quantities of user information that was previously locked away in silos.” ( As Privacy Matters recently [noted](https://twitter.com/PrivacyMatters/status/1052562585223073793) on Twitter, Facebook’s data policy states, “We collect information about the people, Pages, accounts, hashtags and groups that you are connected to and how you interact with them across our Products, such as people you communicate with the most or groups that you are part of.”)\n\nZuckerberg also acknowledged that an encrypted Facebook may pose problems for law enforcement and intelligence services, but promised that the company would work with authorities to root out bad guys who “misuse it for truly terrible things like child exploitation, terrorism, and extortion.” It’s unclear how, with end-to-end encryption, it will be able to do this. Facebook’s private groups have already been used to incite genocide and other acts of violence, suppress voter turnout, and disseminate misinformation. Its pivot to privacy will not only give such activities more space to operate behind the relative shelter of a digital wall but will also relieve Facebook from the responsibility of policing them. Instead of more—and more exacting—content moderation, there will be less. Instead of removing bad actors from the service, the pivot to privacy will give them a safe harbor. \n\nIf “town square” Facebook is, as Zuckerberg and his associates like to say, “a neutral platform,” this new “living room” Facebook, where people gather in smallish, obscure groups, is likely to be a broadcast channel for all sorts of odious and malevolent ideas and behaviors. We’ve seen this already on WhatsApp. Last year, mobs in India were incited to kill more than two dozen innocent people after false rumors of a child-kidnapping ring were spread through the messaging app. As the New York *Times* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/18/technology/whatsapp-india-killings.html) at the time, “WhatsApp’s design makes it easy to spread false information. Many messages are shared in groups, and when they are forwarded, there is no indication of their origin.” (According to the *Times,* WhatsApp subsequently introduced new labels for forwarded messages, ran newspaper ads to warn the public about misinformation, and vowed to work more closely with police.) Instagram has also been an effective tool for spreading misinformation. According to data shared with the Senate Intelligence Committee last December, between [2015 and 2017](https://www.thedailybeast.com/tech-giants-have-done-bare-minimum-to-help-russia-investigation-senate-intel-committee-told), Russian propagandists working out of the Internet Research Agency generated posts that garnered a hundred and eighty-seven million interactions on the photo-sharing app, which was more engagement than they accomplished on either Facebook or Twitter. An encrypted Instagram will be a boon to trolls.\n\nLast week, the relentless British journalist Carole Cadwalladr, along with her colleague Duncan Campbell, [reported in the *Observer*](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/02/facebook-global-lobbying-campaign-against-data-privacy-laws-investment) that Facebook has been pressuring politicians around the world to lobby against imposing regulations on the social network, offering investments and other incentives. (A Facebook spokesperson told the *Observer* that the documents forming the basis of the reporting were “cherrypicked.”) In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is considering whether to fine Facebook billions of dollars for violating a 2011 consent decree intended to protect users’ private data. In Wednesday’s announcement, Zuckerberg, who is famous for shambling apologies, seemed to have finally run out of mea culpas. “I understand that many people don’t think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy-focused platform,” he wrote, “because frankly we don’t currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services.” On that point, at least, he’s right.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Facebook","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark

[Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mark-zuckerberg), the C.E.O. of Facebook, has been posting occasional essays about the future of his company. The most recent, published on Wednesday, outlines “a privacy-focused vision for social networking.” “Public social networks will continue to be very important in people’s lives,” Zuckerberg writes. But “the future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services.” He hopes to build such platforms, and expand the ones the company already owns. He isn’t proposing to dismantle Facebook as it currently exists. The Facebook to come, he explains, will facilitate “private interactions”; it will feature “reduced permanence,” with content disappearing automatically, Snapchat-style; it will allow for messages, video chats, monetary transactions, and “other kinds of private services” that are encrypted “end-to-end.” (This type of encryption “prevents anyone—including us—from seeing what people share,” Zuckerberg explains.)  Zuckerberg wants to supplement “the platforms we’ve already built to help people share and connect more openly” with “platforms for private sharing.” The idea is to let you use Facebook in secret.\n\nThe move toward privacy seems designed to respond to a number of problems. To some extent, it responds to Facebook’s content-moderation problem: if a conversation that violates the company’s “community guidelines” is encrypted, such that even Facebook’s software can’t read it, then the company can’t be expected to expunge it. It responds to the Ralph Northam-yearbook problem (“People want to know that what they share won’t come back to hurt them later”), since, by default, content will auto-delete.  And it responds to the China problem, as Zuckerberg vows “not to build data centers in countries that have a track record of violating human rights like privacy or freedom of expression.” It also attempts to address Facebook’s public-relations problem: after a scandalous year, fewer people trust the network than ever.\n\nWhat it does not and cannot address is the social-media problem. That problem, essentially, is centralization. It’s extraordinary that one company—and, to an extent, one person—has the power to reshape the way that billions of people communicate, not just once but over and over again. In its original incarnation, Facebook helped turn ordinary people into broadcasters; this had predictable, desirable consequences (baby photos; gratitude challenges; rainbow-hued demonstrations of solidarity) and unpredictable, disastrous ones (harassment; anti-vaxxers; Russian trolls). Almost certainly, Facebook’s privacy initiatives will result in good and bad outcomes that are hard to predict—and those outcomes, whatever they are, will unfold at a massive, global scale, affecting societies around the world simultaneously. That scale, in itself, is a problem—one that Facebook will never solve.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark Zuckerberg","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mark-zuckerberg"},{"id":"5c2e1c78ee7fe02cbd163327","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Privacy","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"privacy"}],"sections":[{"id":"59f0d2a0d2beb9720f019591","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Current","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"current"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e5e72179605b11ad9914","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Joshua Rothman, the ideas editor of newyorker.com, has been a writer and an editor at the magazine since 2012.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/joshua-rothman","email":"","name":"Joshua Rothman","socialMedia":[{"network":"Twitter","handle":"joshuarothman"}],"title":"Joshua Rothman, the ideas editor of newyorker.com, has been a writer and an editor at the magazine since 2012."}]},"dek":"","hed":"Mark Zuckerberg Announces Facebook’s Pivot to Privacy","inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2019-03-07T15:37:12.199Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"5c8059507622202cdb7d6495","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"2:1":{"width":2560,"height":1280,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":39,"height":1280,"width":2560}},"duration":null},"2:2":{"width":628,"height":628,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":437,"y":107,"height":628,"width":628}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":2560,"height":1440,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1440,"width":2560,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":2275,"height":1706,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":0,"height":1706,"width":2275}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":1706,"height":1706,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":136,"y":0,"height":1706,"width":1706}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/tny-services/production/2019/03/06/5c80594f7622202cdb7d6494_Rothman-Facebook.jpg","width":2560,"height":1707,"duration":null}},"altText":"Mark Zuckerberg","credit":"Photograph by Paul Morris / Bloomberg / Getty","filename":"Rothman-Facebook.jpg","revision":1,"tags":[],"title":"","variants":{}}]},"promoDek":"After a scandalous year for the social-networking site, the move toward privacy seems designed to respond to a number of problems.

He does not enjoy interviews, especially after two years of ceaseless controversy. Having got his start as a programmer with a nocturnal bent, he is also not a morning person. Walking toward the kitchen, which has a long farmhouse table and cabinets painted forest green, he said, “I haven’t eaten breakfast yet. Have you?”\n\nSince 2011, Zuckerberg has lived in a century-old white clapboard Craftsman in the Crescent Park neighborhood, an enclave of giant oaks and historic homes not far from Stanford University. The house, which cost seven million dollars, affords him a sense of sanctuary. It’s set back from the road, shielded by hedges, a wall, and mature trees. Guests enter through an arched wooden gate and follow a long gravel path to a front lawn with a saltwater pool in the center. The year after Zuckerberg bought the house, he and his longtime girlfriend, Priscilla Chan, held their wedding in the back yard, which encompasses gardens, a pond, and a shaded pavilion. Since then, they have had two children, and acquired a seven-hundred-acre estate in Hawaii, a ski retreat in Montana, and a four-story town house on Liberty Hill, in San Francisco. But the family’s full-time residence is here, a ten-minute drive from Facebook’s headquarters.\n\nOccasionally, Zuckerberg records a Facebook video from the back yard or the dinner table, as is expected of a man who built his fortune exhorting employees to keep “pushing the world in the direction of making it a more open and transparent place.” But his appetite for personal openness is limited. Although Zuckerberg is the most famous entrepreneur of his generation, he remains elusive to everyone but a small circle of family and friends, and his efforts to protect his privacy inevitably attract attention. The local press has chronicled his feud with a developer who announced plans to build a mansion that would look into Zuckerberg’s master bedroom. After a legal fight, the developer gave up, and Zuckerberg spent forty-four million dollars to buy the houses surrounding his. Over the years, he has come to believe that he will always be the subject of criticism. “We’re not—pick your noncontroversial business—selling dog food, although I think that people who do that probably say there is controversy in that, too, but this is an inherently cultural thing,” he told me, of his business. “It’s at the intersection of technology and psychology, and it’s very personal.”\n\nHe carried a plate of banana bread and a carafe of water into the living room, and settled onto a navy-blue velvet sofa. Since co-founding Facebook, in 2004, his uniform has evolved from hoodies and flip-flops to his current outfit, a gray sweater, indigo jeans, and black Nikes. At thirty-four, Zuckerberg, who has very fair skin, a tall forehead, and large eyes, is leaner than when he first became a public figure, more than a decade ago. On the porch, next to the front door, he keeps a Peloton stationary bike, a favorite accessory in the tech world, which live-streams a personal trainer to your home. Zuckerberg uses the machine, but he does not love cycling. A few years ago, on his first attempt to use a road bike with racing pedals, he forgot to unclip, tipped over, and broke his arm. Except for cycling on his porch, he said, “I haven’t clipped in since.”\n\nHe and his wife prefer board games to television, and, within reach of the couch, I noticed a game called Ricochet Robots. “It gets extremely competitive,” Zuckerberg said. “We play with these friends, and one of them is a genius at this. Playing with him is just infuriating.” Dave Morin, a former Facebook employee who is the founder and C.E.O. of Sunrise Bio, a startup seeking cures for depression, used to play Risk with Zuckerberg at the office. “He’s not playing you in a game of Risk. He’s playing you in a game of games,” Morin told me. “The first game, he might amass all his armies on one property, and the next game he might spread them all over the place. He’s trying to figure out the psychological way to beat you in all the games.”\n\nAcross the tech industry, the depth of Zuckerberg’s desire to win is often remarked upon. Dick Costolo, the former C.E.O. of [Twitter](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Twitter), told me, “He’s a ruthless execution machine, and if he has decided to come after you, you’re going to take a beating.” Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, said, “There are a number of people in the Valley who have a perception of Mark that he’s really aggressive and competitive. I think some people are a little hesitant about him from that perspective.” Hoffman has been an investor in Facebook since its early days, but for a long time he sensed that Zuckerberg kept his distance because they were both building social networks. “For many years, it was, like, ‘Your LinkedIn thing is going to be crushed, so even though we’re friendly, I don’t want to get too close to you personally, because I’m going to crush you.’ Now, of course, that’s behind us and we’re good friends.”\n\nWhen I asked Zuckerberg about this reputation, he framed the dynamic differently. The survival of any social-media business rests on “network effects,” in which the value of the network grows only by finding new users. As a result, he said, “there’s a natural zero-sumness. If we’re going to achieve what we want to, it’s not just about building the best features. It’s about building the best community.” He added, “I care about succeeding. And, yes, sometimes you have to beat someone to something, in order to get to the next thing. But that’s not primarily the way that I think I roll.”\n\nFor many years, Zuckerberg ended Facebook meetings with the half-joking exhortation “Domination!” Although he eventually stopped doing this (in European legal systems, “dominance” refers to corporate monopoly), his discomfort with losing is undimmed. A few years ago, he played Scrabble on a corporate jet with a friend’s daughter, who was in high school at the time. She won. Before they played a second game, he wrote a simple computer program that would look up his letters in the dictionary so that he could choose from all possible words. Zuckerberg’s program had a narrow lead when the flight landed. The girl told me, “During the game in which I was playing the program, everyone around us was taking sides: Team Human and Team Machine.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIf Facebook were a country, it would have the largest population on earth. More than 2.2 billion people, about a third of humanity, log in at least once a month. That user base has no precedent in the history of American enterprise. Fourteen years after it was founded, in Zuckerberg’s dorm room, Facebook has as many adherents as Christianity.\n\nA couple of years ago, the company was still revelling in its power. By collecting vast quantities of information about its users, it allows advertisers to target people with precision—a business model that earns Facebook more ad revenue in a year than all American newspapers combined. Zuckerberg was spending much of his time conferring with heads of state and unveiling plans of fantastical ambition, such as building giant drones that would beam free Internet (including Facebook) into developing countries. He enjoyed extraordinary control over his company; in addition to his positions as chairman and C.E.O., he controlled about sixty per cent of shareholder votes, thanks to a special class of stock with ten times the power of ordinary shares. His personal fortune had grown to more than sixty billion dollars. Facebook was one of four companies (along with Google, Amazon, and Apple) that dominated the Internet; the combined value of their stock is larger than the G.D.P. of France.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cfdbd07a5060baeb7b]||||||\n+++\n\nFor years, Facebook had heard concerns about its use of private data and its ability to shape people’s behavior. The company’s troubles came to a head during the Presidential election of 2016, when propagandists used the site to spread misinformation that helped turn society against itself. Some of the culprits were profiteers who gamed Facebook’s automated systems with toxic political clickbait known as “fake news.” In a prime example, at least a hundred Web sites were traced to Veles, Macedonia, a small city where entrepreneurs, some still in high school, discovered that posting fabrications to pro-[Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) Facebook groups unleashed geysers of traffic. Fake-news sources also paid Facebook to “microtarget” ads at users who had proved susceptible in the past.\n\nThe other culprits, according to U.S. intelligence, were Russian agents who wanted to sow political chaos and help Trump win. In February, [Robert Mueller](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mueller), the special counsel investigating Russia’s role in the election, charged thirteen Russians with an “interference operation” that made use of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The Internet Research Agency, a firm in St. Petersburg working for the Kremlin, drew hundreds of thousands of users to Facebook groups optimized to stoke outrage, including Secured Borders, Blacktivist, and Defend the 2nd. They used Facebook to organize offline rallies, and bought Facebook ads intended to hurt Hillary Clinton’s standing among Democratic voters. (One read “Hillary Clinton Doesn’t Deserve the Black Vote.”) With fewer than a hundred operatives, the I.R.A. achieved an astonishing impact: Facebook estimates that the content reached as many as a hundred and fifty million users.\n\nAt the same time, former Facebook executives, echoing a growing body of research, began to voice misgivings about the company’s role in exacerbating isolation, outrage, and addictive behaviors. One of the largest studies, published last year in the _American Journal of Epidemiology_, followed the Facebook use of more than five thousand people over three years and found that higher use correlated with self-reported declines in physical health, mental health, and life satisfaction. At an event in November, 2017, Sean Parker, Facebook’s first president, called himself a “conscientious objector” to social media, saying, “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.” A few days later, Chamath Palihapitiya, the former vice-president of user growth, told an audience at Stanford, “The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works—no civil discourse, no coöperation, misinformation, mistruth.” Palihapitiya, a prominent [Silicon Valley](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Silicon-Valley) figure who worked at Facebook from 2007 to 2011, said, “I feel tremendous guilt. I think we all knew in the back of our minds.” Of his children, he added, “They’re not allowed to use this shit.” (Facebook replied to the remarks in a statement, noting that Palihapitiya had left six years earlier, and adding, “Facebook was a very different company back then.”)\n\nIn March, Facebook was confronted with an even larger scandal: the _Times_ and the British newspaper the _Observer_ reported that a researcher had gained access to the personal information of Facebook users and sold it to [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Cambridge-Analytica), a consultancy hired by Trump and other Republicans which advertised using “psychographic” techniques to manipulate voter behavior. In all, the personal data of eighty-seven million people had been harvested. Moreover, Facebook had known of the problem since December of 2015 but had said nothing to users or regulators. The company acknowledged the breach only after the press discovered it.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica revelations touched off the most serious crisis in Facebook’s history, and, with it, a public reckoning with the power of Big Tech. Facebook is now under investigation by the F.B.I., the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as by authorities abroad, from London to Brussels to Sydney. Facebook’s peers and rivals have expressed conspicuously little sympathy. [Elon Musk](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Elon-Musk) deleted his Facebook pages and those of his companies, Tesla and SpaceX. [Tim Cook](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Tim-Cook), the C.E.O. of Apple, told an interviewer, “We could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer,” but “we’ve elected not to do that.” At Facebook’s annual shareholder meeting, in May, executives struggled to keep order. An investor who interrupted the agenda to argue against Zuckerberg’s renomination as chairman was removed. Outside, an airplane flew a banner that read “*YOU BROKE DEMOCRACY.*{: .small}” It was paid for by Freedom from Facebook, a coalition of progressive groups that have asked the F.T.C. to break up the company into smaller units.\n\nOn July 25th, Facebook’s stock price dropped nineteen per cent, cutting its market value by a hundred and nineteen billion dollars, the largest one-day drop in Wall Street history. Nick Bilton, a technology writer at _Vanity Fair_, tweeted that Zuckerberg was losing $2.7 million per second, “double what the average American makes in an entire lifetime.” Facebook’s user base had flatlined in the U.S. and Canada, and dropped slightly in Europe, and executives warned that revenue growth would decline further, in part because the scandals had led users to opt out of allowing Facebook to collect some data. Facebook depends on trust, and the events of the past two years had made people wonder whether the company deserved it.\n\nZuckerberg’s friends describe his travails as a by-product of his success. He is often compared to another Harvard dropout, [Bill Gates](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Bill-Gates), who has been his mentor in business and philanthropy. Gates told me, “Somebody who is smart, and rich, and ends up not acknowledging problems as quickly as they should will be attacked as arrogant. That comes with the territory.” He added, “I wouldn’t say that Mark’s an arrogant individual.” But, to critics, Facebook is guilty of a willful blindness driven by greed, naïveté, and contempt for oversight.\n\nIn a series of conversations over the summer, I talked to Zuckerberg about Facebook’s problems, and about his underlying views on technology and society. We spoke at his home, at his office, and by phone. I also interviewed four dozen people inside and outside the company about its culture, his performance, and his decision-making. I found Zuckerberg straining, not always coherently, to grasp problems for which he was plainly unprepared. These are not technical puzzles to be cracked in the middle of the night but some of the subtlest aspects of human affairs, including the meaning of truth, the limits of free speech, and the origins of violence.\n\nZuckerberg is now at the center of a full-fledged debate about the moral character of Silicon Valley and the conscience of its leaders. Leslie Berlin, a historian of technology at Stanford, told me, “For a long time, Silicon Valley enjoyed an unencumbered embrace in America. And now everyone says, Is this a trick? And the question Mark Zuckerberg is dealing with is: Should my company be the arbiter of truth and decency for two billion people? Nobody in the history of technology has dealt with that.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nFacebook’s headquarters, at 1 Hacker Way, in Menlo Park, overlooking the salt marshes south of San Francisco, has the feel of a small, prosperous dictatorship, akin to Kuwait or Brunei. The campus is a self-contained universe, with the full range of free Silicon Valley perks: dry cleaning, haircuts, music lessons, and food by the acre, including barbecue, biryani, and salad bars. (New arrivals are said to put on the “Facebook fifteen.”) Along with stock options and generous benefits, such trappings have roots in the nineteen-seventies, when, Leslie Berlin said, founders aspired to create pleasant workplaces and stave off the rise of labor unions. The campus, which was designed with the help of consultants from Disney, is arranged as an ersatz town that encircles a central plaza, with shops and restaurants and offices along a main street. From the air, the word “*Hack*{: .small}” is visible in gigantic letters on the plaza pavement.\n\nOn Zuckerberg’s campus, he is king. Executives offer fulsome praise. David Marcus, who runs Facebook’s blockchain project, told me recently, “When I see him portrayed in certain ways, it really hurts me personally, because it’s not the guy he is.” Even when colleagues speak more candidly, on the whole they like him. “He’s not an asshole,” a former senior executive told me. “That’s why people work there so long.”\n\nBefore I visited Zuckerberg for the first time, in June, members of his staff offered the kind of advice usually reserved for approaching a skittish bird: proceed gingerly, build a connection, avoid surprises. The advice, I discovered, wasn’t necessary. In person, he is warmer and more direct than his public pronouncements, which resemble a politician’s bland pablum, would suggest. The contrast between the public and the private Zuckerberg reminded me of Hillary Clinton. In both cases, friends complain that the popular image is divorced from the casual, funny, generous person they know. Yet neither Zuckerberg nor Clinton has found a way to publicly express a more genuine persona. In Zuckerberg’s case, moments of self-reflection are so rare that, last spring, following a CNN interview in which he said that he wanted to build a company that “my girls are going to grow up and be proud of me for,” the network framed the clip as a news event, with the title “Zuckerberg in rare emotional moment.”\n\nI asked Zuckerberg about his aversion to opening up.“I’m not the most polished person, and I will say something wrong, and you see the cost of that,” he said. “I don’t want to inflict that pain, or do something that’s going to not reflect well on the people around me.” In the most recent flap, a few weeks earlier, he had told Kara Swisher, the host of the “[Recode Decode](https://www.recode.net/2018/7/18/17575158/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-full-transcript-kara-swisher)” podcast, that he permits Holocaust deniers on Facebook because he isn’t sure if they are “intentionally getting it wrong.” After a furor erupted, he issued a statement saying that he finds Holocaust denial “deeply offensive.” Zuckerberg told me, “In an alternate world where there weren’t the compounding experiences that I had, I probably would have gotten more comfortable being more personal, and out there, and I wouldn’t have felt pushback every time I did something. And maybe my persona, or at least how I felt comfortable acting publicly, would shift.”\n\nThe downside of Zuckerberg’s exalted status within his company is that it is difficult for him to get genuine, unexpurgated feedback. He has tried, at times, to puncture his own bubble. In 2013, as a New Year’s resolution, he pledged to meet someone new, outside Facebook, every day. In 2017, he travelled to more than thirty states on a “listening tour” that he hoped would better acquaint him with the outside world. David Plouffe, President Obama’s former campaign manager, who is now the head of policy and advocacy at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the family’s philanthropic investment company, attended some events on the tour. He told me, “When a politician goes to one of those, it’s an hour, and they’re talking for fifty of those minutes. He would talk for, like, five, and just ask questions.”\n\nBut the exercise came off as stilted and tone-deaf. Zuckerberg travelled with a professional photographer, who documented him feeding a calf in Wisconsin, ordering barbecue, and working on an assembly line at a Ford plant in Michigan. Online, people joked that the photos made him look like an extraterrestrial exploring the human race for the first time. A former Facebook executive who was involved in the tour told a friend, “No one wanted to tell Mark, and no one did tell Mark, that this really looks just dumb.”\n\nZuckerberg has spent nearly half his life inside a company of his own making, handpicking his lieutenants, and sculpting his environment to suit him. Even Facebook’s signature royal blue reflects his tastes. He is red-green color-blind, and he chose blue because he sees it most vividly. [Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Sheryl-Sandberg), the chief operating officer, told me, “Sometimes Mark will say, in front of the company, ‘Well, I’ve never worked anywhere else, but Sheryl tells me .&#160;.&#160;.’&#160;” She went on, “He acknowledges he doesn’t always have the most experience. He’s only had the experience he’s had, and being Mark Zuckerberg is pretty extraordinary.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nLong before it seemed inevitable or even plausible, Mark Elliot Zuckerberg had an outsized sense of his own potential. It was “a teleological frame of feeling almost chosen,” a longtime friend told me. “I think Mark has always seen himself as a man of history, someone who is destined to be great, and I mean that in the broadest sense of the term.” Zuckerberg has observed that more than a few giants of history grew up in bourgeois comfort near big cities and then channelled those advantages into transformative power.\n\nIn Zuckerberg’s case, the setting was Dobbs Ferry, New York, a Westchester County suburb twenty-five miles north of New York City. His mother, Karen Kempner, grew up in Queens; on a blind date, she met a mailman’s son, Edward Zuckerberg, of Flatbush, who was studying to be a dentist. They married and had four children. Mark, the only boy, was the second-oldest. His mother, who had become a psychiatrist, eventually gave up her career to take care of the kids and manage the dental office, which was connected to the family home. Of his father, Zuckerberg told me, “He was a dentist, but he was also a huge techie. So he always had not just a system for drilling teeth but, like, the laser system for drilling teeth that was controlled by the computer.” Ed Zuckerberg marketed himself as the Painless Dr. Z, and later drummed up dentistry business with a direct-mail solicitation that declared, “I am literally the Father of Facebook!” (Since 2013, Zuckerberg’s parents have lived in California, where Ed practices part time and lectures on using social media to attract patients.)\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cf2c0c1035aeefc65e]||||||\n+++\n\nIn the nineteen-eighties and nineties, Ed bought early personal computers—the Atari 800, the I.B.M. XT—and Mark learned to code. At twelve, he set up his first network, ZuckNet, on which messages and files could be shared between the house and his father’s dental office. Rabbi David Holtz, of Temple Beth Abraham, in Tarrytown, told me that he watched Zuckerberg with other kids and sensed that he was “beyond a lot of his peers. He was thinking about things that other people were not.” When I asked Zuckerberg where his drive came from, he traced it to his grandparents, who had immigrated from Europe in the early twentieth century. “They came over, went through the Great Depression, had very hard lives,” he said. “Their dream for their kids was that they would each become doctors, which they did, and my mom just always believed that we should have a bigger impact.” His eldest sister, Randi, an early Facebook spokesperson, has gone on to write books and host a radio show; Donna received her Ph.D. in classics from Princeton and edits an online classics journal; Arielle has worked at Google and as a venture capitalist.\n\nWhen Zuckerberg was a junior in high school, he transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy, where he spent most of his time coding, fencing, and studying Latin. Ancient Rome became a lifelong fascination, first because of the language (“It’s very much like coding or math, and so I appreciated that”) and then because of the history. Zuckerberg told me, “You have all these good and bad and complex figures. I think Augustus is one of the most fascinating. Basically, through a really harsh approach, he established two hundred years of world peace.” For non-classics majors: Augustus Caesar, born in 63 B.C., staked his claim to power at the age of eighteen and turned Rome from a republic into an empire by conquering Egypt, northern Spain, and large parts of central Europe. He also eliminated political opponents, banished his daughter for promiscuity, and was suspected of arranging the execution of his grandson.\n\n“What are the trade-offs in that?” Zuckerberg said, growing animated. “On the one hand, world peace is a long-term goal that people talk about today. Two hundred years feels unattainable.” On the other hand, he said, “that didn’t come for free, and he had to do certain things.” In 2012, Zuckerberg and Chan spent their honeymoon in Rome. He later said, “My wife was making fun of me, saying she thought there were three people on the honeymoon: me, her, and Augustus. All the photos were different sculptures of Augustus.” The couple named their second daughter August.\n\nIn 2002, Zuckerberg went to [Harvard](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/harvard), where he embraced the hacker mystique, which celebrates brilliance in pursuit of disruption. “The ‘fuck you’ to those in power was very strong,” the longtime friend said. In 2004, as a sophomore, he embarked on the project whose origin story is now well known: the founding of Thefacebook.com with four fellow-students (“the” was dropped the following year); the legal battles over ownership, including a suit filed by twin brothers, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, accusing Zuckerberg of stealing their idea; the disclosure of embarrassing messages in which Zuckerberg mocked users for giving him so much data (“they ‘trust me.’ dumb fucks,” he wrote); his regrets about those remarks, and his efforts, in the years afterward, to convince the world that he has left that mind-set behind.\n\nDuring Zuckerberg’s sophomore year, in line for the bathroom at a party, he met Priscilla Chan, who was a freshman. Her parents, who traced their roots to China, had grown up in Vietnam and arrived in the U.S. as refugees after the war, settling in Quincy, Massachusetts, where they washed dishes in a Chinese restaurant. Priscilla was the eldest of three daughters, and the first member of her family to go to college. “I suddenly go to Harvard, where there’s this world where people had real and meaningful intellectual pursuits,” she said. “Then I met Mark, who so exemplified that.” She was struck by how little Zuckerberg’s background had in common with her own. “Fifty per cent of people go to college from the high school I went to. You could learn how to be a carpenter or a mechanic,” she said. “I was just, like, ‘This person speaks a whole new language and lives in a framework that I’ve never seen before.’&#160;” She added, “Maybe there was some judgment on my part: ‘You don’t understand me because you went to Phillips Exeter,’&#160;” but, she said, “I had to realize early on that I was not going to change who Mark was.” After Harvard, Chan taught in a primary school and eventually became a pediatrician. In 2017, she stopped seeing patients to be the day-to-day head of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. When I asked Chan about how Zuckerberg had responded at home to the criticism of the past two years, she talked to me about _Sitzfleisch_, the German term for sitting and working for long periods of time. “He’d actually sit so long that he froze up his muscles and injured his hip,” she said.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAfter his sophomore year, Zuckerberg moved to Palo Alto and never left. Even by the standards of Silicon Valley, Facebook’s first office had a youthful feel. Zuckerberg carried two sets of business cards. One said “I’m CEO .&#160;.&#160;. bitch!” Visitors encountered a graffiti mural of a scantily clad woman riding a Rottweiler. In Adam Fisher’s “[Valley of Genius](https://www.amazon.com/Valley-Genius-Uncensored-History-Founders/dp/1455559024/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1536591936&sr=8-1&keywords=valley+of+genius+the+uncensored+history+of+silicon+valley),” an oral history of Silicon Valley, an early employee named Ezra Callahan muses, “&#160;‘How much was the direction of the internet influenced by the perspective of nineteen-, twenty-, twenty-one-year-old well-off white boys?’ That’s a real question that sociologists will be studying forever.”\n\nFacebook was fortunate to launch when it did: Silicon Valley was recovering from the dot-com bust and was entering a period of near-messianic ambitions. The Internet was no longer so new that users were scarce, but still new enough that it was largely unregulated; first movers could amass vast followings and consolidate power, and the coming rise of inexpensive smartphones would bring millions of new people online. Most important, Facebook capitalized on a resource that most people hardly knew existed: the willingness of users to subsidize the company by handing over colossal amounts of personal information, for free.\n\nIn Facebook, Zuckerberg had found the instrument to achieve his conception of greatness. His onetime speechwriter Katherine Losse, in her memoir, “[The Boy Kings](https://www.amazon.com/Boy-Kings-Journey-Social-Network/dp/1451668260/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1536591916&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Boy+Kings),” explained that the “engineering ideology of Facebook” was clear: “Scaling and growth are everything, individuals and their experiences are secondary to what is necessary to maximize the system.” Over time, Facebook devoted ever-greater focus to what is known in Silicon Valley as “growth hacking,” the constant pursuit of scale. Whenever the company talked about “connecting people,” that was, in effect, code for user growth.\n\nThen, in 2007, growth plateaued at around fifty million users and wouldn’t budge. Other social networks had maxed out at around that level, and Facebook employees wondered if they had hit a hidden limit. Zuckerberg created a special Growth Team, which had broad latitude to find ways of boosting the numbers. Among other fixes, they discovered that, by offering the site in more languages, they could open huge markets. Alex Schultz, a founding member of the Growth Team, said that he and his colleagues were fanatical in their pursuit of expansion. “You will fight for that inch, you will die for that inch,” he told me. Facebook left no opportunity untapped. In 2011, the company asked the Federal Election Commission for an exemption to rules requiring the source of funding for political ads to be disclosed. In filings, a Facebook lawyer argued that the agency “should not stand in the way of innovation.”\n\nSandy Parakilas, who joined Facebook in 2011, as an operations manager, paraphrased the message of his orientation session as “We believe in the religion of growth.” He said, “The Growth Team was the coolest. Other teams would even try to call subgroups within their teams the ‘Growth X’ or the ‘Growth Y’ to try to get people excited.”\n\nTo gain greater reach, Facebook had made the fateful decision to become a “platform” for outside developers, much as Windows had been in the realm of desktop computers, a generation before. The company had opened its trove of data to programmers who wanted to build Facebook games, personality tests, and other apps. After a few months at Facebook, Parakilas was put in charge of a team responsible for making sure that outsiders were not misusing the data, and he was unnerved by what he found. Some games were siphoning off users’ messages and photographs. In one case, he said, a developer was harvesting user information, including that of children, to create unauthorized profiles on its own Web site. Facebook had given away data before it had a system to check for abuse. Parakilas suggested that there be an audit to uncover the scale of the problem. But, according to Parakilas, an executive rejected the idea, telling him, “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?”\n\nParakilas told me, “It was very difficult to get the kind of resources that you needed to do a good job of insuring real compliance. Meanwhile, you looked at the Growth Team and they had engineers coming out of their ears. All the smartest minds are focussed on doing whatever they can possibly do to get those growth numbers up.”\n\nNew hires learned that a crucial measure of the company’s performance was how many people had logged in to Facebook on six of the previous seven days, a measurement known as L6/7\\. “You could say it’s how many people love this service so much they use it six out of seven days,” Parakilas, who left the company in 2012, said. “But, if your job is to get that number up, at some point you run out of good, purely positive ways. You start thinking about ‘Well, what are the dark patterns that I can use to get people to log back in?’&#160;”\n\nFacebook engineers became a new breed of behaviorists, tweaking levers of vanity and passion and susceptibility. The real-world effects were striking. In 2012, when Chan was in medical school, she and Zuckerberg discussed a critical shortage of organs for transplant, inspiring Zuckerberg to add a small, powerful nudge on Facebook: if people indicated that they were organ donors, it triggered a notification to friends, and, in turn, a cascade of social pressure. Researchers later found that, on the first day the feature appeared, it increased official organ-donor enrollment more than twentyfold nationwide.\n\nSean Parker later described the company’s expertise as “exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.” The goal: “How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?” Facebook engineers discovered that people find it nearly impossible not to log in after receiving an e-mail saying that someone has uploaded a picture of them. Facebook also discovered its power to affect people’s political behavior. Researchers found that, during the 2010 midterm elections, Facebook was able to prod users to vote simply by feeding them pictures of friends who had already voted, and by giving them the option to click on an “I Voted” button. The technique boosted turnout by three hundred and forty thousand people—more than four times the number of votes separating Trump and Clinton in key states in the 2016 race. It became a running joke among employees that Facebook could tilt an election just by choosing where to deploy its “I Voted” button.\n\nThese powers of social engineering could be put to dubious purposes. In 2012, Facebook data scientists used nearly seven hundred thousand people as guinea pigs, feeding them happy or sad posts to test whether emotion is contagious on social media. (They concluded that it is.) When the findings were published, in the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_, they caused an uproar among users, many of whom were horrified that their emotions may have been surreptitiously manipulated. In an apology, one of the scientists wrote, “In hindsight, the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this anxiety.”\n\nFacebook was, in the words of Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google, becoming a pioneer in “persuasive technology.” He explained, “A hammer, in your hand, is non-persuasive—it doesn’t have its own ways of manipulating the person that holds it. But Facebook and Snapchat, in their design features, are persuading a teen-ager to wake up and see photo after photo after photo of their friends having fun without them, even if it makes them feel worse.” In 2015, Harris delivered a talk at Facebook about his concern that social media was contributing to alienation. “I said, ‘You guys are in the best position in the world to deal with loneliness and see it as a thing that you are amplifying and a thing that you can help make go the other way,’&#160;” he told me. “They didn’t do anything about it.” He added, “My points were in their blind spot.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs Facebook grew, Zuckerberg and his executives adopted a core belief: even if people criticized your decisions, they would eventually come around. In one of the first demonstrations of that idea, in 2006, Facebook introduced the News Feed, a feature that suddenly alerted friends whenever a user changed profile pictures, joined groups, or altered a relationship status. (Until then, users had to visit a friend’s page to see updates.) Users revolted. There was a street protest at the headquarters, and hundreds of thousands of people joined a Facebook group opposing the change. Zuckerberg posted a tepid apology (“Calm down. Breathe. We hear you.”), and people got used to the feed.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cf477b8357353ab502]||||||\n+++\n\n“A lot of the early experience for me was just having people really not believe that what we were going to do was going to work,” Zuckerberg told me. “If you think about the early narratives, it was, like, ‘Well, this was just a college thing.’ Or ‘It’s not gonna be a big deal.’ Or ‘O.K., other people are using it, but it’s kind of a fad. There’s Friendster and there’s MySpace, and there will be something after,’ or whatever.” He added, “I feel like it really tests you emotionally to have constant doubt, and the assertion that you don’t know what you are doing.”\n\nIn 2006, Zuckerberg made his most unpopular decision at the fledgling company. Yahoo was offering a billion dollars to buy Facebook and, as Matt Cohler, a top aide at the time, recalls, “Our growth had stalled out.” Cohler and many others implored Zuckerberg to take the offer, but he refused. “I think nearly all of his leadership team lost faith in him and in the business,” Cohler said. Zuckerberg told me that most of his leadership “left within eighteen months. Some of them I had to fire because it was just too dysfunctional. It just completely blew up. But the thing that I learned from that is, if you stick with your values and with what you believe you want to be doing in the world, you can get through. Sometimes it will take some time, and you have to rebuild, but that’s a pretty powerful lesson.”\n\nOn several occasions, Zuckerberg stumbled when it came to issues of privacy. In 2007, Facebook started giving advertisers a chance to buy into a program called Beacon, which would announce to a user’s friends what that user was browsing for, or buying, online. Users could opt out, but many had no idea that the feature existed until it revealed upcoming holiday gifts, or, in some cases, exposed extramarital affairs. Zuckerberg apologized (“We simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize for it,” he wrote), and Beacon was withdrawn.\n\nDespite the apology, Zuckerberg was convinced that he was ahead of his users, not at odds with them. In 2010, he said that privacy was no longer a “social norm.” That year, the company found itself in trouble again after it revised its privacy controls to make most information public by default. The Federal Trade Commission cited Facebook for “engaging in unfair and deceptive practices” with regard to the privacy of user data. The company signed a consent decree pledging to establish a “comprehensive privacy program” and to evaluate it every other year for twenty years. In a post, Zuckerberg offered a qualified apology: “I think that a small number of high profile mistakes .&#160;.&#160;. have often overshadowed much of the good work we’ve done.”\n\nFacebook had adopted a buccaneering motto, “Move fast and break things,” which celebrated the idea that it was better to be flawed and first than careful and perfect. Andrew Bosworth, a former Harvard teaching assistant who is now one of Zuckerberg’s longest-serving lieutenants and a member of his inner circle, explained, “A failure can be a form of success. It’s not the form you want, but it can be a useful thing to how you learn.” In Zuckerberg’s view, skeptics were often just fogies and scolds. “There’s always someone who wants to slow you down,” he said in a commencement address at Harvard last year. “In our society, we often don’t do big things because we’re so afraid of making mistakes that we ignore all the things wrong today if we do nothing. The reality is, anything we do will have issues in the future. But that can’t keep us from starting.”\n\nZuckerberg’s disregard for criticism entered a more emphatic phase in 2010, with the release of the movie “[The Social Network](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/10/04/influencing-people),” an account of Facebook’s early years, written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher. Some of the film was fictionalized. It presented Zuckerberg’s motivation largely as a desire to meet girls, even though, in real life, he was dating Priscilla Chan for most of the time period covered in the movie. But other elements cut close to the truth, including the depiction of his juvenile bravado and the early feuds over ownership. Zuckerberg and Facebook had chosen not to be involved in the production, and the portrayal was unflattering. Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, is cocksure and cold, and the real Zuckerberg found the depiction hurtful. “First impressions matter a lot, and for a lot of people that was their introduction to me,” he told me. “My reaction to this, to all these things, is primarily that I perceive it through the employees.” His concern was less about how people would think of him, he said, than about “how is our company, how are our employees—these people I work with and care so much about—how are they going to process this?”\n\nBefore the movie came out, Facebook executives debated how to respond. Zuckerberg settled on a stance of effortful good cheer, renting a movie theatre to screen it for the staff. Eight years later, Facebook executives still mention what they call, resentfully, “the movie.” Sandberg, who is the company’s second most important public figure, and one of Zuckerberg’s most ardent defenders, told me, “From its facts to its essence to its portrayal, I think that was a very unfair picture. I still think it forms the basis of a lot of what people believe about Mark.”\n\nWhile the movie contributed to the fortress mentality on campus, Zuckerberg made a series of decisions that solidified his confidence in his instincts. In 2012, he paid a billion dollars for [Instagram](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/instagram), the photo-sharing service, which at the time had only thirteen employees. Outside the industry, the startup appeared wildly overpriced, but it proved to be one of the best investments in the history of the Internet. (Today, Instagram is valued at more than a hundred times what Zuckerberg paid for it, and, even more important, it is popular with young people, a cohort that shows declining interest in Facebook.) That spring, Facebook went public on the Nasdaq, at a valuation of a hundred and four billion dollars. There were technical glitches on the day of the listing, and many people doubted that the company could earn enough money to justify the valuation. The share price promptly sank. The _Wall Street Journal_ called the I.P.O. a “[fiasco](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304821304577436873952633672),” and shareholders sued Facebook and Zuckerberg. “We got a ton of criticism,” he recalled. “Our market cap got cut in half. But what I felt was, we were at a sufficient skill and complexity that it was going to take a couple years to work through the problem, but I had strong conviction that we were doing the right thing.” (Even with its recent plunge, the value of Facebook stock has more than quadrupled in the years since.)\n\nZuckerberg was happy to make sharp turns to achieve his aims. In 2011, when users started moving from desktop computers to phones, Facebook swerved toward mobile technology. Zuckerberg told employees that he would kick them out of his office if their ideas did not account for the transition. “Within a month, you literally can’t meet with Mark if you’re not bringing him a mobile product,” Bosworth recalled.\n\nIn 2014, as problems accumulated, Facebook changed its motto, “Move fast and break things,” to the decidedly less glamorous “Move fast with stable infrastructure.” Still, internally, much of the original spirit endured, and the push for haste began to take a toll in the offline world. In early 2016, Zuckerberg directed employees to accelerate the release of Facebook Live, a video-streaming service, and expanded its team of engineers from twelve to more than a hundred. When the product emerged, two months later, so did unforeseen issues: the service let users flag videos as inappropriate, but it didn’t give them a way to indicate where in a broadcast the problem appeared. As a result, Facebook Live videos of people committing suicide, or engaged in criminal activity, started circulating before reviewers had time to race through, find the issues, and take the videos down. A few months after the service launched, a Chicago man named Antonio Perkins was fatally shot on Facebook Live and the video was viewed hundreds of thousands of times.\n\nThe incident might have served as a warning to slow down, but, instead, the next day, Bosworth sent around a remarkable internal memo justifying some of Facebook’s “ugly” physical and social effects as the trade-offs necessary for growth: “Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is \\*de facto\\* good.”\n\nThis spring, after the memo [leaked to BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data), Bosworth said that he had been playing devil’s advocate, and Zuckerberg issued a statement: “Boz is a talented leader who says many provocative things. This was one that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly. We’ve never believed the ends justify the means.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nZuckerberg was also experimenting with [philanthropy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/27/gospels-of-giving-for-the-new-gilded-age). In 2010, shortly before the release of “The Social Network,” he made a high-profile gift. Appearing onstage at “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” along with Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, and Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, he announced a hundred-million-dollar donation to help Newark’s struggling public-school system. [The project](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/schooled) quickly encountered opposition from local groups that saw it as out of touch, and, eight years later, it’s generally considered a failure. In May, Ras Baraka, Newark’s mayor, said of the donation, “You can’t just cobble up a bunch of money and drop it in the middle of the street and say, ‘This is going to fix everything.’&#160;”\n\nFor all the criticism, the project has produced some measurable improvements. A Harvard study found greater gains in English than the state average, and a study by MarGrady Research, an education-policy group, found that high-school graduation rates and over-all student enrollment in Newark have risen since the donation. Zuckerberg emphasizes those results, even as he acknowledges flaws in his approach. “Your earning potential is dramatically higher if you graduate from high school versus not. That part of it, I think, is the part that worked and it was effective,” he said. “There were a bunch of other things that we tried that either were much harder than we thought or just didn’t work.” Strategies that helped him in business turned out to hurt him in education reform. “I think in a lot of philanthropy and government-related work, if you try five things and a few of them fail, then the ones that fail are going to get a lot of the attention,” he said.\n\nIn 2015, Zuckerberg and Chan pledged to spend ninety-nine per cent of their Facebook fortune “to advance human potential and promote equality for all children in the next generation.” They created the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited-liability company that gives to charity, invests in for-profit companies, and engages in political advocacy. David Plouffe said that the lessons of the Newark investment shaped the initiative’s perspective. “I think the lesson was, you have to do this in full partnership with the community, not just the leaders,” he said. “You need to have enthusiastic buy-in from superintendents, and teachers, and parents.”\n\nIn contrast to a traditional foundation, an L.L.C. can lobby and give money to politicians, without as strict a legal requirement to disclose activities. In other words, rather than trying to win over politicians and citizens in places like Newark, Zuckerberg and Chan could help elect politicians who agree with them, and rally the public directly by running ads and supporting advocacy groups. (A spokesperson for C.Z.I. said that it has given no money to candidates; it has supported ballot initiatives through a 501(c)(4) social-welfare organization.) “The whole point of the L.L.C. structure is to allow a coördinated attack,” Rob Reich, a co-director of Stanford’s Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society, told me. The structure has gained popularity in Silicon Valley but has been criticized for allowing wealthy individuals to orchestrate large-scale social agendas behind closed doors. Reich said, “There should be much greater transparency, so that it’s not dark. That’s not a criticism of Mark Zuckerberg. It’s a criticism of the law.”\n\nIn 2016, Zuckerberg announced, onstage and in a Facebook post, his intention to “help cure all disease in our children’s lifetime.” That was partly bluster: C.Z.I. is working on a slightly more realistic agenda, to “cure, prevent or manage all diseases.” The theatrics irritated some in the philanthropy world who thought that Zuckerberg’s presentation minimized the challenges, but, in general, scientists have applauded the ambition. When I asked Zuckerberg about the reception of the project, he said, “It’s funny, when I talk to people here in the Valley, you get a couple of reactions. A bunch of people have the reaction of ‘Oh, that’s obviously going to happen on its own—why don’t you just spend your time doing something else?’ And then a bunch of people have the reaction of ‘Oh, that seems almost impossible—why are you setting your sights so high?’&#160;”\n\nCharacteristically, Zuckerberg favors the optimistic scenario. “On average, every year for the last eighty years or so, I think, life expectancy has gone up by about a quarter of a year. And, if you believe that technological and scientific progress is not going to slow, there is a potential upside to speeding that up,” he said. “We’re going to get to a point where the life expectancy implied by extrapolating that out will mean that we’ll basically have been able to manage or cure all of the major things that people suffer from and die from today. Based on the data that we already see, it seems like there’s a reasonable shot.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3ce01fe0d4c650956c9]||||||\n+++\n\nI asked Bill Gates, whose private foundation is the largest in the U.S., about Zuckerberg’s objectives. “There are aspirations and then there are plans,” he said. “And plans vary in terms of their degree of realism and concreteness.” He added that Zuckerberg’s long-range goal is “very safe, because you will not be around to write the article saying that he overcommitted.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs Facebook expanded, so did its blind spots. The company’s financial future relies partly on growth in developing countries, but the platform has been a powerful catalyst of violence in fragile parts of the globe. In India, the largest market for Facebook’s WhatsApp service, hoaxes have triggered riots, lynchings, and fatal beatings. Local officials resorted to shutting down the Internet sixty-five times last year. In Libya, people took to Facebook to trade weapons, and armed groups relayed the locations of targets for artillery strikes. In Sri Lanka, after a Buddhist mob attacked Muslims this spring over a false rumor, a Presidential adviser told the _[Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/world/asia/facebook-sri-lanka-riots.html)_, “The germs are ours, but Facebook is the wind.”\n\nNowhere has the damage been starker than in [Myanmar](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Myanmar), where the Rohingya Muslim minority has been subject to brutal killings, gang rapes, and torture. In 2012, around one per cent of the country’s population had access to the Internet. Three years later, that figure had reached twenty-five per cent. Phones often came preloaded with the Facebook app, and Buddhist extremists seeking to inflame ethnic tensions with the Rohingya mastered the art of misinformation. Wirathu, a monk with a large Facebook following, sparked a deadly riot against Muslims in 2014 when he shared a fake report of a rape and warned of a “Jihad against us.” Others gamed Facebook’s rules against hate speech by fanning paranoia about demographic change. Although Muslims make up no more than five per cent of the country, a popular graphic appearing on Facebook cautioned that “when Muslims become the most powerful” they will offer “Islam or the sword.”\n\nBeginning in 2013, a series of experts on Myanmar met with Facebook officials to warn them that it was fuelling attacks on the Rohingya. David Madden, an entrepreneur based in Myanmar, delivered a presentation to officials at the Menlo Park headquarters, pointing out that the company was playing a role akin to that of the radio broadcasts that spread hatred during the Rwandan genocide. In 2016, C4ADS, a Washington-based nonprofit, published a detailed analysis of Facebook usage in Myanmar, and described a “campaign of hate speech that actively dehumanizes Muslims.” Facebook officials said that they were hiring more Burmese-language reviewers to take down dangerous content, but the company repeatedly declined to say how many had actually been hired. By last March, the situation had become dire: almost a million Rohingya had fled the country, and more than a hundred thousand were confined to internal camps. The United Nations investigator in charge of examining the crisis, which the U.N. has deemed a genocide, said, “I’m afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it was originally intended.” Afterward, when pressed, Zuckerberg repeated the claim that Facebook was “hiring dozens” of additional Burmese-language content reviewers.\n\nMore than three months later, I asked Jes Kaliebe Petersen, the C.E.O. of Phandeeyar, a tech hub in Myanmar, if there had been any progress. “We haven’t seen any tangible change from Facebook,” he told me. “We don’t know how much content is being reported. We don’t know how many people at Facebook speak Burmese. The situation is getting worse and worse here.”\n\nI saw Zuckerberg the following morning, and asked him what was taking so long. He replied, “I think, fundamentally, we’ve been slow at the same thing in a number of areas, because it’s actually the same problem. But, yeah, I think the situation in Myanmar is terrible.” It was a frustrating and evasive reply. I asked him to specify the problem. He said, “Across the board, the solution to this is we need to move from what is fundamentally a reactive model to a model where we are using technical systems to flag things to a much larger number of people who speak all the native languages around the world and who can just capture much more of the content.”\n\nI told him that people in Myanmar are incredulous that a company with Facebook’s resources has failed to heed their complaints. “We’re taking this seriously,” he said. “You can’t just snap your fingers and solve these problems. It takes time to hire the people and train them, and to build the systems that can flag stuff for them.” He promised that Facebook would have “a hundred or more Burmese-speaking people by the end of the year,” and added, “I hate that we’re in this position where we are not moving as quickly as we would like.” A few weeks after our conversation, Facebook announced that it was banning Myanmar’s Army chief and several other military officials.\n\nOver the years, Zuckerberg had come to see his ability to reject complaints as a virtue. But, by 2016, that stance had primed the company for a crisis. Tristan Harris, the design ethicist, said, “When you’re running anything like Facebook, you get criticized all the time, and you just stop paying attention to criticism if a lot of it is not well founded. You learn to treat it as naïve and uninformed.” He went on, “The problem is it also puts you out of touch with genuine criticism from people who actually understand the issues.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe 2016 election was supposed to be good for Facebook. That January, Sheryl Sandberg told investors that the election would be “a big deal in terms of ad spend,” comparable to the Super Bowl and the World Cup. According to Borrell Associates, a research and consulting firm, candidates and other political groups were on track to spend $1.4 billion online in the election, up ninefold from four years earlier.\n\nFacebook offered to “embed” employees, for free, in Presidential campaign offices to help them use the platform effectively. Clinton’s campaign said no. Trump’s said yes, and Facebook employees helped his campaign craft messages. Although Trump’s language was openly hostile to ethnic minorities, inside Facebook his behavior felt, to some executives, like just part of the distant cesspool of Washington. Americans always seemed to be choosing between a hated Republican and a hated Democrat, and Trump’s descriptions of Mexicans as rapists was simply an extension of that.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump used Facebook to raise two hundred and eighty million dollars. Just days before the election, his team paid for a voter-suppression effort on the platform. According to _Bloomberg Businessweek_, it targeted three Democratic constituencies—“idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans”—sending them videos precisely tailored to discourage them from turning out for Clinton. Theresa Hong, the Trump campaign’s digital-content director, later told an interviewer, “Without Facebook we wouldn’t have won.”\n\nAfter the election, Facebook executives fretted that the company would be blamed for the spread of fake news. Zuckerberg’s staff gave him statistics showing that the vast majority of election information on the platform was legitimate. At a tech conference a few days later, Zuckerberg was defensive. “The idea that fake news on Facebook—of which, you know, it’s a very small amount of the content—influenced the election in any way, I think, is a pretty crazy idea,” he said. To some at Facebook, Zuckerberg’s defensiveness was alarming. A former executive told [_Wired_,](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-2-years-of-hell/) “We had to really flip him on that. We realized that if we didn’t, the company was going to start heading down this pariah path.”\n\nWhen I asked Zuckerberg about his “pretty crazy” comment, he said that he was wrong to have been “glib.” He told me, “Nobody wants any amount of fake news. It is an issue on an ongoing basis, and we need to take that seriously.” But he still bristles at the implication that Facebook may have distorted voter behavior. “I find the notion that people would only vote some way because they were tricked to be almost viscerally offensive,” he said. “Because it goes against the whole notion that you should trust people and that individuals are smart and can understand their own experience and can make their own assessments about what direction they want their community to go in.”\n\nShortly after the election, Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, contacted Facebook to discuss Russian interference. “The initial reaction was completely dismissive,” he told me. But, by the spring, he sensed that the company was realizing that it had a serious problem. “They were seeing an enormous amount of Russian activity in the French elections,” Warner said. “It was getting better, but I still don’t think they were putting nearly enough resources behind this.” Warner, who made a fortune in the telecom business, added, “Most of the companies in the Valley think that policymakers, one, don’t get it, and, two, that ultimately, if they just stonewall us, then we’ll go away.”\n\nFacebook moved fitfully to acknowledge the role it had played in the election. In September of 2017, after Robert Mueller obtained a search warrant, Facebook agreed to give his office an inventory of ads linked to Russia and the details of who had paid for them. In October, Facebook disclosed that Russian operatives had published about eighty thousand posts, reaching a hundred and twenty-six million Americans.\n\nIn March, after the Cambridge Analytica news broke, Zuckerberg and Facebook were paralyzed. For five days, Zuckerberg said nothing. His personal Facebook profile offered no statements or analysis. Its most recent post was a photo of him and Chan baking hamantaschen for Purim.\n\n“I feel like we’ve let people down and that feels terrible,” he told me later. “But it goes back to this notion that we shouldn’t be making the same mistake multiple times.” He insists that fake news is less common than people imagine: “The average person might perceive, from how much we and others talk about it, that there is more than ten times as much misinformation or hoax content on Facebook than the academic measures that we’ve seen so far suggest.” He is still not convinced that the spread of misinformation had an impact on the election. “I actually don’t consider that a closed thing,” he said. “I still think that’s the kind of thing that needs to be studied.”\n\nIn conversation, Zuckerberg is, unsurprisingly, highly analytical. When he encounters a theory that doesn’t accord with his own, he finds a seam of disagreement—a fact, a methodology, a premise—and hammers at it. It’s an effective technique for winning arguments, but one that makes it difficult to introduce new information. Over time, some former colleagues say, his deputies have begun to filter out bad news from presentations before it reaches him. A former Facebook official told me, “They only want to hear good news. They don’t want people who are disagreeing with them. There is a culture of ‘You go along to get along.’&#160;”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cfbc66792cd5fab4be]||||||\n+++\n\nI once asked Zuckerberg what he reads to get the news. “I probably mostly read aggregators,” he said. “I definitely follow Techmeme”—a roundup of headlines about his industry—“and the media and political equivalents of that, just for awareness.” He went on, “There’s really no newspaper that I pick up and read front to back. Well, that might be true of most people these days—most people don’t read the physical paper—but there aren’t many news Web sites where I go to browse.”\n\nA couple of days later, he called me and asked to revisit the subject. “I felt like my answers were kind of vague, because I didn’t necessarily feel like it was appropriate for me to get into which specific organizations or reporters I read and follow,” he said. “I guess what I tried to convey, although I’m not sure if this came across clearly, is that the job of uncovering new facts and doing it in a trusted way is just an absolutely critical function for society.”\n\nZuckerberg and Sandberg have attributed their mistakes to excessive optimism, a blindness to the darker applications of their service. But that explanation ignores their fixation on growth, and their unwillingness to heed warnings. Zuckerberg resisted calls to reorganize the company around a new understanding of privacy, or to reconsider the depth of data it collects for advertisers.\n\nJames P. Steyer, the founder and C.E.O. of Common Sense Media, an organization that promotes safety in technology and media for children, visited Facebook’s headquarters in the spring of 2018 to discuss his concerns about a product called Messenger Kids, which allows children under thirteen—the minimum age to use the primary Facebook app—to make video calls and send messages to contacts that a parent approves. He met with Sandberg and Elliot Schrage, at the time the head of policy and communications. “I respect their business success, and like Sheryl personally, and I was hoping they might finally consider taking steps to better protect kids. Instead, they said that the best thing for young kids was to spend more time on Messenger Kids,” Steyer told me. “They still seemed to be in denial. Would _you_ ‘move fast and break things’ when it comes to children? To our democracy? No, because you can damage them forever.”\n\nTo some people in the company, the executives seemed concentrated not on solving the problems or on preventing the next ones but on containing the damage. Tavis McGinn, a former Google pollster, started working at Facebook in the spring of 2017, doing polls with a narrow focus: measuring the public perception of Zuckerberg and Sandberg. During the next six months, McGinn conducted eight surveys and four focus groups in three countries, collecting the kinds of measurements favored by politicians and advertisers. Facebook polled reactions to the company’s new stated mission to “bring the world closer together,” as well as to items on Zuckerberg’s social-media feed, including his writings, photographs, and even his casual banter during a back-yard barbecue broadcast on Facebook Live.\n\nIn September, McGinn resigned. In an interview, he told the Web site the Verge that he had become discouraged. “I was not going to be able to change the way that the company does business,” he said. “I couldn’t change the values. I couldn’t change the culture.” He concluded that measuring the “true social outcomes” of Facebook was of limited interest to senior staffers. “I think research can be very powerful, if people are willing to listen,” he said. “But I decided after six months that it was a waste of my time to be there. I didn’t feel great about the product. I didn’t feel proud to tell people I worked at Facebook. I didn’t feel I was helping the world.” (McGinn, who has signed a nondisclosure agreement with Facebook, declined to comment for this article.)\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn March, Zuckerberg agreed to testify before Congress for the first time about Facebook’s handling of user data. The hearing was scheduled for April. As the date approached, the hearing acquired the overtones of a trial.\n\nIn barely two years, the mood in Washington had shifted. Internet companies and entrepreneurs, formerly valorized as the vanguard of American ingenuity and the astronauts of our time, were being compared to Standard Oil and other monopolists of the Gilded Age. This spring, the _Wall Street Journal_ published [an article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/techs-titans-tiptoe-toward-monopoly-1527783845) that began, “Imagine a not-too-distant future in which trustbusters force Facebook to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp.” It was accompanied by a sepia-toned illustration in which portraits of Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and other tech C.E.O.s had been grafted onto overstuffed torsos meant to evoke the robber barons. In 1915, Louis Brandeis, the reformer and future Supreme Court Justice, testified before a congressional committee about the dangers of corporations large enough that they could achieve a level of near-sovereignty “so powerful that the ordinary social and industrial forces existing are insufficient to cope with it.” He called this the “curse of bigness.” Tim Wu, a Columbia law-school professor and the author of a forthcoming book inspired by Brandeis’s phrase, told me, “Today, no sector exemplifies more clearly the threat of bigness to democracy than Big Tech.” He added, “When a concentrated private power has such control over what we see and hear, it has a power that rivals or exceeds that of elected government.”\n\nShortly before Zuckerberg was due to testify, a team from the Washington law firm of WilmerHale flew to Menlo Park to run him through mock hearings and to coach him on the requisite gestures of humility. Even before the recent scandals, Bill Gates had advised Zuckerberg to be alert to the opinions of lawmakers, a lesson that Gates had learned in 1998, when Microsoft faced accusations of monopolistic behavior. Gates testified to Congress, defiantly, that “the computer-software industry is not broken, and there is no need to fix it.” Within months, the Department of Justice sued Microsoft for violating federal antitrust law, leading to three years of legal agony before a settlement was reached. Gates told me that he regretted “taunting” regulators, saying, “Not something I would choose to repeat.” He encouraged Zuckerberg to be attentive to D.C. “I said, ‘Get an office there—now.’ And Mark did, and he owes me,” Gates said. Last year, Facebook spent $11.5 million on lobbying in Washington, ranking it between the American Bankers Association and General Dynamics among top spenders.\n\nOn April 10th, when Zuckerberg arrived at the [Senate hearing](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/what-was-missing-from-mark-zuckerbergs-first-day-of-congressional-testimony), he wore a sombre blue suit, and took a seat before more than forty senators. In front of him, his notes outlined likely questions and answers, including the prospect that a senator might ask him to step down from the company. His answer, in shorthand, would be: “Founded Facebook. My decisions. I made mistakes. Big challenge, but we’ve solved problems before, going to solve this one. Already taking action.”\n\nAs it turned out, nobody asked him to resign—or much of anything difficult. Despite scattered moments of pressure, the overwhelming impression left by the event was how poorly some senators grasped the issues. In the most revealing moment, Orrin Hatch, the eighty-four-year-old Republican from Utah, demanded to know how Facebook makes money if “users don’t pay for your service.” Zuckerberg replied, “Senator, we run ads,” allowing a small smile.\n\nTo observers inclined to distrust Zuckerberg, he was evasive to the point of amnesiac—he said, more than forty times, that he would need to follow up—but when the hearing concluded, after five hours, he had emerged unscathed, and Wall Street, watching closely, rewarded him by boosting the value of Facebook’s stock by twenty billion dollars. A few days later, on the internal Facebook message board, an employee wrote that he planned to buy T-shirts reading “Senator, we run ads.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWhen I asked Zuckerberg whether policymakers might try to break up Facebook, he replied, adamantly, that such a move would be a mistake. The field is “extremely competitive,” he told me. “I think sometimes people get into this mode of ‘Well, there’s not, like, an exact replacement for Facebook.’ Well, actually, that makes it _more_ competitive, because what we really are is a system of different things: we compete with Twitter as a broadcast medium; we compete with Snapchat as a broadcast medium; we do messaging, and iMessage is default-installed on every iPhone.” He acknowledged the deeper concern. “There’s this other question, which is just, laws aside, how do we feel about these tech companies being big?” he said. But he argued that efforts to “curtail” the growth of Facebook or other Silicon Valley heavyweights would cede the field to China. “I think that anything that we’re doing to constrain them will, first, have an impact on how successful we can be in other places,” he said. “I wouldn’t worry in the near term about Chinese companies or anyone else winning in the U.S., for the most part. But there are all these places where there are day-to-day more competitive situations—in Southeast Asia, across Europe, Latin America, lots of different places.”\n\nThe rough consensus in Washington is that regulators are unlikely to try to break up Facebook. The F.T.C. will almost certainly fine the company for violations, and may consider blocking it from buying big potential competitors, but, as a former F.T.C. commissioner told me, “in the United States you’re allowed to have a monopoly position, as long as you achieve it and maintain it without doing illegal things.”\n\nFacebook is encountering tougher treatment in Europe, where antitrust laws are stronger and the history of fascism makes people especially wary of intrusions on privacy. One of the most formidable critics of Silicon Valley is the [European Union](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/european-union)’s top antitrust regulator, Margrethe Vestager. Last year, after an investigation of Google’s search engine, Vestager accused the company of giving an “illegal advantage” to its shopping service and fined it $2.7 billion, at that time the largest fine ever imposed by the E.U. in an antitrust case. In July, she added another five-billion-dollar fine for the company’s practice of requiring device makers to preinstall Google apps.\n\nIn Brussels, Vestager is a high-profile presence—nearly six feet tall, with short black-and-silver hair. She grew up in rural Denmark, the eldest child of two Lutheran pastors, and, when I spoke to her recently, she talked about her enforcement powers in philosophical terms. “What we’re dealing with, when people start doing something illegal, is exactly as old as Adam and Eve,” she said. “Human decisions very often are guided by greed, by fear of being pushed out of the marketplace, or of losing something that’s important to you. And then, if you throw power into that cocktail of greed and fear, you have something that you can recognize throughout time.”\n\nVestager told me that her office has no open cases involving Facebook, but she expressed concern that the company was taking advantage of users, beginning with terms of service that she calls “unbalanced.” She paraphrased those terms as “It’s your data, but you give us a royalty-free global license to do, basically, whatever we want.” Imagine, she said, if a brick-and-mortar business asked to copy all your photographs for its unlimited, unspecified uses. “Your children, from the very first day until the confirmation, the rehearsal dinner for the wedding, the wedding itself, the first child being baptized. You would never accept that,” she said. “But this is what you accept without a blink of an eye when it’s digital.”\n\nIn Vestager’s view, a healthy market should produce competitors to Facebook that position themselves as ethical alternatives, collecting less data and seeking a smaller share of user attention. “We need social media that will allow us to have a nonaddictive, advertising-free space,” she said. “You’re more than welcome to be successful and to dramatically outgrow your competitors if customers like your product. But, if you grow to be dominant, you have a special responsibility not to misuse your dominant position to make it very difficult for others to compete against you and to attract potential customers. Of course, we keep an eye on it. If we get worried, we will start looking.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5b92f3cf477b8357353ab503]||||||\n+++\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs the pressure on Facebook has intensified, the company has been moving to fix its vulnerabilities. In December, after Sean Parker and Chamath Palihapitiya spoke publicly about the damaging psychological effects of social media, Facebook acknowledged evidence that heavy use can exacerbate anxiety and loneliness. After years of perfecting addictive features, such as “auto-play” videos, it announced a new direction: it would promote the quality, rather than the quantity, of time spent on the site. The company modified its algorithm to emphasize updates from friends and family, the kind of content most likely to promote “active engagement.” In a post, Zuckerberg wrote, “We can help make sure that Facebook is time well spent.”\n\nThe company also grappled with the possibility that it would once again become a vehicle for election-season propaganda. In 2018, hundreds of millions of people would be voting in elections around the world, including in the U.S. midterms. After years of lobbying against requirements to disclose the sources of funding for political ads, the company announced that users would now be able to look up who paid for a political ad, whom the ad targeted, and which other ads the funders had run.\n\nSamidh Chakrabarti, the product manager in charge of Facebook’s “election integrity” work, told me that the revelations about Russia’s Internet Research Agency were deeply alarming. “This wasn’t the kind of product that any of us thought that we were working on,” he said. With the midterms approaching, the company had discovered that Russia’s model for exploiting Facebook had inspired a generation of new actors similarly focussed on skewing political debate. “There are lots of copycats,” Chakrabarti said.\n\nZuckerberg used to rave about the virtues of “frictionless sharing,” but these days Facebook is working on “imposing friction” to slow the spread of disinformation. In January, the company hired Nathaniel Gleicher, the former director for cybersecurity policy on President Obama’s National Security Council, to blunt “information operations.” In July, it removed thirty-two accounts running disinformation campaigns that were traced to Russia. A few weeks later, it removed more than six hundred and fifty accounts, groups, and pages with links to Russia or Iran. Depending on your point of view, the removals were a sign either of progress or of the growing scale of the problem. Regardless, they highlighted the astonishing degree to which the security of elections around the world now rests in the hands of Gleicher, Chakrabarti, and other employees at Facebook.\n\nAs hard as it is to curb election propaganda, Zuckerberg’s most intractable problem may lie elsewhere—in the struggle over which opinions can appear on Facebook, which cannot, and who gets to decide. As an engineer, Zuckerberg never wanted to wade into the realm of content. Initially, Facebook tried blocking certain kinds of material, such as posts featuring nudity, but it was forced to create long lists of exceptions, including images of breast-feeding, “acts of protest,” and works of art. Once Facebook became a venue for political debate, the problem exploded. In April, in a call with investment analysts, Zuckerberg said glumly that it was proving “easier to build an A.I. system to detect a nipple than what is hate speech.”\n\nThe cult of growth leads to the curse of bigness: every day, a billion things were being posted to Facebook. At any given moment, a Facebook “content moderator” was deciding whether a post in, say, Sri Lanka met the standard of hate speech or whether a dispute over Korean politics had crossed the line into bullying. Zuckerberg sought to avoid banning users, preferring to be a “platform for all ideas.” But he needed to prevent Facebook from becoming a swamp of hoaxes and abuse. His solution was to ban “hate speech” and impose lesser punishments for “misinformation,” a broad category that ranged from crude deceptions to simple mistakes. Facebook tried to develop rules about how the punishments would be applied, but each idiosyncratic scenario prompted more rules, and over time they became byzantine. According to Facebook training slides published by the _Guardian_ last year, moderators were told that it was permissible to say “You are such a Jew” but not permissible to say “Irish are the best, but really French sucks,” because the latter was defining another people as “inferiors.” Users could not write “Migrants are scum,” because it is dehumanizing, but they could write “Keep the horny migrant teen-agers away from our daughters.” The distinctions were explained to trainees in arcane formulas such as “Not Protected + Quasi protected = not protected.”\n\nIn July, the issue landed, inescapably, in Zuckerberg’s lap. For years, Facebook had provided a platform to the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, whose delusions include that the parents of children killed in the [Sandy Hook school massacre](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/newtown-shooting) are paid actors with an anti-gun agenda. Facebook was loath to ban Jones. When people complained that his rants violated rules against harassment and fake news, Facebook experimented with punishments. At first, it “reduced” him, tweaking the algorithm so that his messages would be shown to fewer people, while feeding his fans articles that fact-checked his assertions.\n\nThen, in late July, Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, the parents of Noah Pozner, a child killed at Sandy Hook, published an open letter addressed “Dear Mr Zuckerberg,” in which they described “living in hiding” because of death threats from conspiracy theorists, after “an almost inconceivable battle with Facebook to provide us with the most basic of protections.” In their view, Zuckerberg had “deemed that the attacks on us are immaterial, that providing assistance in removing threats is too cumbersome, and that our lives are less important than providing a safe haven for hate.”\n\nFacebook relented, somewhat. On July 27th, it took down four of Jones’s videos and suspended him for a month. But public pressure did not let up. On August 5th, the dam broke after Apple, saying that the company “does not tolerate hate speech,” stopped distributing five podcasts associated with Jones. Facebook shut down four of Jones’s pages for “repeatedly” violating rules against hate speech and bullying. I asked Zuckerberg why Facebook had wavered in its handling of the situation. He was prickly about the suggestion: “I don’t believe that it is the right thing to ban a person for saying something that is factually incorrect.”\n\nJones seemed a lot more than factually incorrect, I said.\n\n“O.K., but I think the facts here are pretty clear,” he said, homing in. “The _initial_ questions were around misinformation.” He added, “We don’t take it down and ban people unless it’s directly inciting violence.” He told me that, after Jones was reduced, more complaints about him flooded in, alerting Facebook to older posts, and that the company was debating what to do when Apple announced its ban. Zuckerberg said, “When they moved, it was, like, O.K., we shouldn’t just be sitting on this content and these enforcement decisions. We should move on what we know violates the policy. We need to make a decision now.”\n\nIt will hardly be the last quandary of this sort. Facebook’s free-speech dilemmas have no simple answers—you don’t have to be a fan of Alex Jones to be unnerved by the company’s extraordinary power to silence a voice when it chooses, or, for that matter, to amplify others, to pull the levers of what we see, hear, and experience. Zuckerberg is hoping to erect a scalable system, an orderly decision tree that accounts for every eventuality and exception, but the boundaries of speech are a bedevilling problem that defies mechanistic fixes. The Supreme Court, defining obscenity, landed on “I know it when I see it.” For now, Facebook is making do with a Rube Goldberg machine of policies and improvisations, and opportunists are relishing it. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, seized on the ban of Jones as a fascist assault on conservatives. In a moment that was rich even by Cruz’s standards, he quoted Martin Niemöller’s famous lines about the Holocaust, saying, “As the poem goes, you know, ‘First they came for Alex Jones.’&#160;”\n\nLast week, testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sandberg said, “We now have over twenty thousand people and we are able to review reports in fifty languages, twenty-four hours a day.” (In the hallway before the session, as if to underscore the complexities ahead, Alex Jones had made a scene, heckling Senator Marco Rubio for not doing more to get him back on Facebook.) In recent years, Sandberg has gained fame for her work outside the company, including her books, “Lean In,” a best-seller on women’s empowerment, and “Option B,” which she wrote after the sudden death of her husband, Dave Goldberg. But her responsibility for the Facebook fallout is likely to grow, and her reputation as C.O.O. hinges on the implementation of changes. Many people in Silicon Valley believe that Sandberg and Facebook’s board of directors must do more to prevent the company from making another major mistake. “I know a couple of guys who are color-blind,” a prominent executive told me, “and their wives lay their clothes out for them in the morning if they don’t want to go out every day looking like Bozo the Clown. Sheryl and the board are expected to lay the clothes out for Mark.” He went on, “If you have blind spots, then you rely on the people around you to tell you where they are.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn one of our conversations, I asked Zuckerberg whether he finds it insulting when people speculate that he lacks emotions. “Insulting?” he asked, and then paused for several seconds to consider. “I don’t find it insulting. I don’t think it’s _accurate_. I mean, I definitely care a lot. There’s a difference between letting emotions drive impulsive decisions and caring.” He went on, “Ultimately, I think the reason that we built this successful thing is because we just solve problem after problem after problem, and typically you don’t do that by making impulsive, emotional decisions.”\n\nThe caricature of Zuckerberg is that of an automaton with little regard for the human dimensions of his work. The truth is something else: he decided long ago that no historical change is painless. Like Augustus, he is at peace with his trade-offs. Between speech and truth, he chose speech. Between speed and perfection, he chose speed. Between scale and safety, he chose scale. His life thus far has convinced him that he can solve “problem after problem after problem,” no matter the howling from the public it may cause.\n\nAt a certain point, the habits of mind that served Zuckerberg well on his ascent will start to work against him. To avoid further crises, he will have to embrace the fact that he’s now a protector of the peace, not a disrupter of it. Facebook’s colossal power of persuasion has delivered fortune but also peril. Like it or not, Zuckerberg is a gatekeeper. The era when Facebook could learn by doing, and fix the mistakes later, is over. The costs are too high, and idealism is not a defense against negligence.\n\nIn some sense, the “Mark Zuckerberg production”—as he called Facebook in its early years—has only just begun. Zuckerberg is not yet thirty-five, and the ambition with which he built his empire could well be directed toward shoring up his company, his country, and his name. The question is not whether Zuckerberg has the power to fix Facebook but whether he has the will; whether he will kick people out of his office—with the gusto that he once mustered for the pivot to mobile—if they don’t bring him ideas for preventing violence in Myanmar, or protecting privacy, or mitigating the toxicity of social media. He succeeded, long ago, in making Facebook great. The challenge before him now is to make it good. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark Zuckerberg","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mark-zuckerberg"},{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c7841c92e2c9b85da16","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Technology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"technology"},{"id":"5c2e1c9936cecf4019214208","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Silicon Valley","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"silicon-valley"},{"id":"5c2e1c83e56e652c90274671","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Social Media","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"social-media"},{"id":"5c2e1df92bc86f2c9a244b40","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tech Companies","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tech-companies"},{"id":"5c2e1f33397f5b30646d086e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Chief Executive Officers (C.E.O.s)","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"chief-executive-officers-ceos"},{"id":"5c2e1c792710c62d1081540b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2016 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2016-election"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a18798b51cf59fc42477f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Profiles","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"profiles"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a02cf1c7a8e33fb390be6","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Evan Osnos joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2008 and covers politics and foreign affairs.

Who, that is, besides Facebook executives and their lawyers? Until a little over a week ago, the company had successfully sequestered internal e-mails, which were obtained by the legal team of Ted Kramer, the founder of the app company Six4Three, during the discovery process in a 2015 lawsuit. At issue was Facebook’s policy of allowing third-party app developers to access the data of Facebook users’ friends—the very policy that enabled [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/cambridge-analytica) to buy the data of eighty-seven million unwitting users on behalf of the Trump campaign. In Kramer’s case, his Pikinis app relied on that access; once Facebook changed its policy, in 2014, the app no longer worked. Kramer cried foul and sued Facebook for breach of contract. At the company’s request, the judge in the case ordered the records sealed to keep them, ironically, private.\n\nThat changed on November 20th, when a parliamentary sergeant-at-arms showed up at Kramer’s London hotel room and escorted him to the halls of Westminster, where the Tory M.P. Damian Collins, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, demanded that Kramer turn over all his files in the case under threat of arrest. Kramer, who was in London on unrelated business, said that he panicked and moved a number of files from a Dropbox account to a USB drive, which he turned over to the M.P. How Collins knew that Kramer was in London has been traced to the tireless *Guardian* reporter Carole Cadwalladr, who has spent more than two years unravelling the connections between Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump), [Steve Bannon](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/steve-bannon), Robert Mercer, and [Brexit](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brexit). After arranging to meet with Kramer, she appears to have [tipped](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/six4three-kramer-collins-facebook) off Collins to Kramer’s whereabouts. But how Collins knew that Kramer was in possession of the documents—which were not his to have—remains a mystery. There are reports that the two men had been in communication for the past few months, at Cadwalladr’s prompting, which suggests that the frog march to Parliament was just for show. (When Kramer’s lawyers found out that he was in possession of the discovery documents and that he had given them to Collins, they attempted to drop him, but, over the weekend, a California judge [demanded](http://fortune.com/2018/12/01/facebook-leak-six4three/) that they continue to represent Kramer until the matter of the purloined files is adjudicated.) \n\nCollins, for his part, claimed that whatever seal was in force in California was irrelevant in the U.K. On November 27th, he used the snatched e-mails to grill Richard Allan, the Facebook executive who was sent to speak for the company at an unprecedented international hearing on fake news and disinformation that Collins convened in Parliament. [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mark-zuckerberg), who said he was too busy to appear—making this the fourth time that he has refused a request from Parliament—was represented by a nameplate positioned in front of an empty chair; every time the television cameras panned to Allan, they also showed his absent boss. Allan admitted that the optics were “not great,” and then went on to do his best Zuckerberg imitation, dodging and feinting as the lawmakers sought to put him on the spot. The most damning [claim](https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-considered-charging-for-access-to-user-data-1543454648) to emerge was that Facebook either gave, or considered giving, favored access to its users’ data to companies that spent at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in advertising on the platform. There also seemed to be [evidence](https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/a3mkxe/facebook-was-aware-of-russian-meddling-as-far-back-as-2014) that Facebook had been informed, in 2014, that computers with Russian I.P. addresses were siphoning three billion data points a day from Facebook accounts, a claim that Allan refused to address in the hearing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Collins published the full cache that he seized from Kramer. The [two hundred and fifty pages](https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/Note-by-Chair-and-selected-documents-ordered-from-Six4Three.pdf) of internal Facebook documents show, irrefutably, that the company did indeed whitelist a number of lucrative business partners, including Netflix, Lyft, and Airbnb, allowing them continued and unfettered access to the accounts of Facebook users and their friends after the company claimed that it had stopped the practice. The documents also reveal that, in 2015, a permissions update for Android devices, which users were required to accept, included a feature that continuously uploaded text messages and call logs to Facebook. \n\nThe fallout from Ted Kramer’s London misadventure was just one debacle of many during Facebook’s terrible, horrible, no good, very bad month. Back at Facebook headquarters, in Menlo Park, Zuckerberg was quite busy after all, doing damage control after a scathing New York *Times* exposé. “[Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook’s Leaders Fought Through Crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html),” which was published on November 14th, created one of the biggest crises in the company’s history. As if to prove the reporters’ claims, Zuckerberg publicly denied their veracity. But the *Times* piece was deeply sourced and contained the disturbing revelation that the company had enlisted a right-wing opposition-research group, Definers Public Affairs, to dig up dirt on [George Soros](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/george-soros) after Soros gave a blistering [speech](https://www.businessinsider.com/george-soros-calls-facebook-google-menace-society-obstacles-innovation-2018-1) at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, decrying the power of social media, especially Facebook and [Google](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/google), for their “far-reaching adverse consequences on the functioning of democracy, particularly on the integrity of elections.”\n\nDefiners Public Affairs had previously [pushed](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/everything-facebook-said-on-sheryl-sandberg-definers-since-nyt-report.html) out misinformation about the Apple C.E.O., Tim Cook, on behalf of the tech company Qualcomm, which wanted to undermine Cook’s relationship with the Trump Administration. For Facebook, Definers launched a P.R. campaign—propagated through the conservative and alt-right media ecospheres—that traded on anti-Semitic innuendo to suggest that Soros was the deep pockets behind a grassroots anti-Facebook group.  News of Facebook’s campaign against Soros came out three weeks after Cesar Sayoc, a fervent Trump supporter, sent a pipe bomb to Soros—and also to the Clintons, the billionaire Tom Steyer, and other prominent Democrats. \n\nAnd then it got worse. On November 15th, shortly after the *Times* exposé was published, Facebook [claimed](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/everything-facebook-said-on-sheryl-sandberg-definers-since-nyt-report.html), “The New York Times is wrong to suggest that we ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebook’s behalf or to spread misinformation.” The next day, Facebook’s chief operating officer, [Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/sheryl-sandberg), who is in charge of the company’s communications team, said, somewhat intricately, “I did not know about or hire Definers or any firm.&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;Definers was hired, we have lots of firms. They were hired not to smear anyone.” But then, the night before Thanksgiving, in a Facebook blog post that the company perhaps thought would be lost in the holiday shuffle, Sandberg allowed that “I did receive a small number of e-mails where Definers was referenced.” A week later, after another damning [piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/technology/definers-public-affairs-tim-miller.html) in the *Times*, a company spokesperson admitted that it was Sandberg herself who had initiated an investigation into whether Soros had a financial interest in criticizing Facebook—that is, if the veteran financier had engaged in what is called “short and distort,” trash-talking a company after betting that its stock will lose value. Not surprisingly, he hadn’t.\n\nSoros’s complaints about Facebook were hardly original: former Facebook employees such as Chamath Palihapitiya, who served as its vice-president for growth, and investors including Roger McNamee have made similar criticisms. Nor was Soros being speculative. At the time of his Davos talk, the company’s role in enabling Russian operatives to exploit social divisions in the United States through Facebook ads and user pages, and helping the Trump campaign suppress the African-American vote, were well known. Indeed, in a two-part “Frontline” documentary, “[The Facebook Dilemma](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/facebook-dilemma/),” which was released at the end of October, a collection of former Facebook employees expressed concerns about the unwillingness of Zuckerberg and Sandberg to take meaningful responsibility for Facebook’s immense power and capacity to do harm. “My concerns, at the time, were that I knew that there were all these malicious actors who would do a wide range of bad things given the opportunity, given the ability to target people based on this information that Facebook had,” Sandy Parakilas, who had been the company’s platform-operations manager in 2011, told the filmmakers. “So I started thinking through what are the worst-case scenarios of what people could do with this data&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;and I shared that with a number of people, both people in privacy and some senior executives. And the response was muted, I would say.&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;I got the sense that this just wasn’t their priority. They weren’t that concerned about the vulnerabilities that the company was creating.”\n\nThose vulnerabilities were on full display on November 5th, the day before the midterm elections. In an effort to prevent the kinds of malign interferences that had dogged the Presidential election two years earlier, Facebook had set up what it was calling a “war room” to monitor its network. The company had already [removed](https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/31/technology/facebook-removes-pages/index.html) thirty Facebook pages, which it believed were designed by Russians to interfere with the elections. The war room was both a public declaration that Facebook was taking fake news and propaganda seriously and an admission that the platform remained susceptible to manipulation. “This is going to be a constant arms race,” Katie Harbath, Facebook’s global-politics and government-outreach director, [told](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/18/17991924/facebook-election-war-room-misinformation-fake-news-whatsapp) the Verge. “This is our new normal. Bad actors are going to get more sophisticated in what they’re doing, and we’re going to have to get more sophisticated in trying to catch them.” Since elections happen around the world throughout the year, the company planned to keep the war room open “for the foreseeable future.”\n\nThat same day, Business for Social Responsibility, a nonprofit organization, issued a report that Facebook had commissioned to address concerns about the platform’s role in the Rohingya genocide, in Myanmar. While the Facebook platform has been used in other countries to cultivate ethnic and sectarian violence—Nigeria, Germany, Egypt, India, and Sri Lanka among them—its co-optation by the Myanmar Army was especially heinous. Adopting the playbook of Russian operatives, the Army created hundreds of seemingly innocuous Facebook accounts about celebrities, entertainment, and beauty, which it used to plant incendiary narratives about the country’s Muslim minority. In its response to the B.S.R. report, Alex Warofka, Facebook’s product-policy manager, said that the company had already implemented a number of its recommendations but that “there is more to do.” \n\nShortly after the Myanmar report was issued, Facebook was compelled to take down an inflammatory, racist [video ad](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-runs-racist-ad-on-facebook-targeting-arizona-and-florida), paid for by the Trump campaign, on the grounds that the ad “violates Facebook’s advertising policy against sensational content.” The spot, which targeted voters in Florida and Arizona, blamed Democrats for an undocumented immigrant who had twice been deported before killing two sheriff’s deputies, in Sacramento, in 2014\\. Facebook’s policy disallows ads that are “dehumanizing or denigrating [to an] entire group of people, and using frightening and exaggerated rumors of danger.” The company removed the ad only after it had already been seen on Facebook by as many as five million people. And here’s the rub: while the ad “cannot receive paid distribution,” the company declared, “the video is allowed to be posted on Facebook.” So there you have it, the fecklessness of Facebook in a single sentence.\n\nNovember has passed, but Facebook’s troubles have not. A departing African-American Facebook employee charged, in a Facebook [post](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/27/facebook-has-problem-black-people-former-employee-says/2126056002/), that the company was “failing its black employees and its black users”; Facebook [took down](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/04/facebook-mark-s-luckie-african-american-workers-users) his post. *Wired* [reported](https://www.wired.com/story/nonprofits-facebook-get-hacked-need-help/) that the company was abandoning charities—which it had lured to the platform—once they’d been hacked. The election war room has been [dismantled](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/26/facebook-wont-use-its-war-room-for-future-elections-report-says.html), leading some to suggest that it was a publicity stunt. Definers Public Affairs is no longer working for Facebook, but the damage to Sheryl Sandberg’s credibility and carefully coiffed public persona may prove irreversible—as Michelle Obama [said](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/03/michelle-obama-lean-in-sheryl-sandberg) the other day, “it’s not always enough to lean in, because that shit doesn’t work all the time.” And that creepy Pikinis app, courtesy of Damian Collins, has now supplied a portrait of naked greed and corporate dissembling. That empty seat in Parliament, where Mark Zuckerberg chose not to sit to answer the concerns of the global community, has suddenly got much hotter.\n\n*A previous version of this article misstated when Facebook first hired Definers Public Affairs.* ","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Facebook","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"facebook"},{"id":"5c2e1c80e56e652c90274670","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Cambridge Analytica","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"cambridge-analytica"},{"id":"5c2e1c7f41c92e2c9b85da26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mark Zuckerberg","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mark-zuckerberg"},{"id":"5c2e1c9781ab3335f580f19e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sheryl Sandberg","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sheryl-sandberg"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f161ebe912338a3717da","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Technology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-technology"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a5ac2e2e17730741c5fa","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sue Halpern, a contributing writer covering politics and technology, has been writing for *The New Yorker* since 2005.

At five degrees of warming, much of the planet would be in constant drought. With just six metres of sea-level rise—an optimistic projection—land where three hundred and seventy-five million people currently live will be underwater. Some of the apocalyptic stories aren’t from the future but our recent past: in the [Paradise Camp Fire](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-californias-efforts-to-prevent-wildfires-reflect-a-national-crisis-on-climate-change) of late 2018, people fleeing the flames “found themselves sprinting past exploding cars, their sneakers melting to the asphalt as they ran.”  \n\nTo anyone who has been paying attention, the broad strokes of “The Uninhabitable Earth” come as no surprise. We are racing toward—in fact have already entered—an era of water shortage, wildfire, sea-level rise, and extreme weather. To read the book is to ask hard questions about one’s own future. When will the city where I live be flooded? Where should I live when it does? Where will my future children live? Should I have children at all?\n\nYet Wallace-Wells has also stressed that there is no place for fatalism. [In an interview with NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/19/695874069/-uninhabitable-earth-draws-attention-to-3-major-misunderstandings-about-climate), he said that “every inch of warming makes a difference”—we cannot stop the process of warming altogether, but we can control whether climate change yields a future that is apocalyptic or instead “merely grim.” Several years ago, I [asked](https://www.guernicamag.com/bill-mckibben-planetary-emergency/) the climate activist and writer [Bill McKibben](https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/bill-mckibben) how he was able to keep from falling into depression, given how much time he devotes to thinking about climate change. He answered that fighting is the key—it’s only despairing if you think that you can’t take on the problem. “It’s the greatest fight in human history, one whose outcome will reverberate for geologic time, and it has to happen right now,” he said.\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, the American Psychological Association put together a task force to examine the relationship between psychology and climate change. It found that, although people said that climate change was important, they did not “feel a sense of urgency.” The task force identified several mental barriers that contributed to this blasé stance. People were uncertain about climate change, mistrustful of the science, or denied that it was related to human activity. They tended to minimize the risks and believe that there was plenty of time to make changes before the real impacts were felt. Just ten years later, these attitudes about climate feel like ancient relics. But two key factors, which the task force identified as keeping people from taking action, have stood the test of time: one was habit, and the other was lack of control. “Ingrained behaviors are extremely resistant to permanent change,” the group stated. “People believe their actions would be too small to make a difference and choose to do nothing.”\n\nWallace-Wells hits this note in his book, too, writing, “We seem most comfortable adopting a learned posture of powerlessness.” As uncertainty and denial about climate have diminished, they have been replaced by similarly paralyzing feelings of panic, anxiety, and resignation. As we begin to live through the massive dangers imparted by climate change, as one psychologist put it to me, “We are in psychological terrain, whether we like it or not.”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nJohn Fraser is a conservation psychologist who has studied burnout and trauma among people doing environmental work. “We have to move beyond terrorizing people with disaster stories,” he told me. Responses to climate change are often discussed as a spectrum, with denial and disengagement at one end and intense alarm on the other. We are getting more alarmed. In 2009, [a Yale and George Mason study](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-december-2018/) grouped Americans’ responses to climate into six categories: alarmed, concerned, cautious, disengaged, doubtful, and dismissive. In 2009, eighteen per cent were alarmed; in 2018, that number had risen to twenty-nine per cent. \n\nFraser wants people to feel not alarmed but activated, and he takes a relentlessly positive, solutions-oriented attitude. “We got trains all the way across America in a few years, and people on the moon in a few years,”  he said. And ideas for climate moonshots abound: [negative-carbon-emission plants](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/can-carbon-dioxide-removal-save-the-world) are prohibitively expensive, but they do exist; some advocate for reviving nuclear power; proponents of a [Green New Deal](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-good-news-about-a-green-new-deal) call for ending fossil-fuel extraction and subsidies, and radically expanding public transportation. In Silicon Valley, ideas are emerging that rely less on politics than on technology, like flooding some deserts to grow carbon-sucking algae beds, or using electrochemistry to get rocks to absorb carbon from the air. Fraser believes that the most productive way to communicate about environmental problems is to emphasize the positive solutions that exist. “What we need to promote is hope,” he said. “The first step to a healthy response is feeling that the problem is solvable.”\n\n“Is it appropriate to feel terrified? No,” Fraser said. “Because you just shut down.”\n\nMargaret Klein Salamon, who trained as a clinical psychologist before founding a [climate-advocacy organization](https://www.theclimatemobilization.org/), takes the opposite view. She doesn’t see fear as paralyzing but as a necessary response that activates people to recognize danger and take action. What’s more, given the state of the atmosphere, she argues that acute fear is rational. “It’s important to feel afraid of things that will kill us—that is healthy and good,” she said. She believes that reckoning with the scope of the emergency is required, both to activate responsible behavior and to reap the mental-health benefits of “living in climate truth.” Salamon, who grew up in a family of psychoanalysts and considers therapy to be “something of a family business,” is writing “Transform Yourself with Climate Truth,” a self-help book on the subject.\n\nSalamon said that it’s no surprise that people can’t process the truth about the climate crisis and instead construct defense mechanisms against it. In twenty years, what now registers as an extreme heat wave will likely be the norm. By 2045, more than three hundred thousand U.S. homes will be lost to encroaching oceans; by 2100, a trillion dollars’ worth of real estate will be lost in the U.S. alone. As atmospheric carbon levels rise, plants produce more sugars and fewer nutrients—by 2050, vegetables will be turning into junk food. There’s a huge overlap between things that wreak havoc on the climate and things that serve a materialist version of the good, comfortable life: meat-eating, air-conditioning, air travel. “It’s a basic part of being human that our minds frequently deal with competing interests—that’s how defense mechanisms are formed,” Salamon said.\n\nSalamon hosts periodic phone sessions in which callers can dial in to discuss their feelings about climate change and climate activism. All sorts of emotions have come up on these calls: guilt and shame, grief, panic, helplessness, even “destructive glee” from people who are angry that their warnings haven’t been heeded. Salamon stresses the importance of processing climate change as an emotional and personal phenomenon, not just a scientific one. Everyone, she said, needs to grieve for his or her own future, which isn’t going to look the way we thought. It’s going to be more parched, more crowded, more dangerous, and more austere.\n \n-=-=-=-\n\nIn October, 2017, Wallace-Wells spoke on a panel at the annual conference of the Society of Environmental Journalists that was titled “Doomsday Stories: The Ethics and Efficacy of Doomsday Reporting.” The conversation largely followed the fault line between scaring readers and offering them hope. Coming down hard on the side of fear, Wallace-Wells passed along something he had been told by the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, who said, “You really can’t let people’s need for hope get in the way of the telling the truth.” And fear is useful, Wallace-Wells said: the threat of mutually assured destruction motivated world leaders to end the Cold War, and fear of cancer has led people to quit smoking. “It’s a little too simplistic to think that anything that is scary is inevitably paralyzing to the public, and I think it’s a little patronizing,” he said. \n\nOne of the other panelists was the psychologist and communications expert Renee Lertzman, who argued that it was necessary to “blow up the dichotomy” between fear and hope, or truth and positivity. The problem with the horror-story narratives is not necessarily that they are frightening, she said, but that they are presented almost cinematically—placing people outside of the action in the “politically neutralizing” position of “titillated, excited, fearful spectators.” In her book “[Environmental Melancholia](https://www.amazon.com/Environmental-Melancholia-Psychoanalytic-dimensions-Explorations/dp/0415727995),” Lertzman argues that unprocessed grief about ecological devastation is a big part of what prevents people from addressing environmental challenges. This “arrested, inchoate form of mourning” keeps people locked in a state of inaction, she writes.\n\nWhen I spoke to Lertzman, she talked about the need to have conversations about climate change that allow space for people to process—or at least acknowledge—their feelings. A gesture as simple as beginning a conversation by allowing a few moments to say, “ ‘Damn, this is intense,’ ” she told me, “frees up a lot of energy to move into problem-solving mode.” This recognition is a familiar move in psychology: first acknowledging that a topic is difficult and then wading in. It reminded me of the way that a doctor with a good bedside manner might approach delivering a difficult diagnosis, but Lertzman said that it’s more complicated than that: because of our culpability in the climate crisis, discussing it is like getting news about a health issue that’s directly related to one’s own habits. You not only have to face a scary future but reckon with how you helped to create it. “We have to come to terms with the fact that what we’re doing is no longer sustainable, and the onus is on us to rise to the occasion,” she said.\n\n“What works really well is when people feel that they are invited and inspired to be part of something constructive, combined with having the safety to grapple with the magnitude of things,” Lertzman told me. This way of thinking loops back to Bill McKibben’s advice, that the only cure for climate agita is activism. Susan Clayton, a professor of social psychology and environmental studies (and a member of the A.P.A.’s climate-change task force, a decade ago), made a similar point, telling me that what’s good for the climate—in the form of participation in a community effort—is also good for the psyche. “It’s similar to the civil-rights movement,” she said. “The act of coming together is empowering and validating.”\n\nIn a poignant essay posted on [Medium](https://medium.com/@maryheglar/sorry-yall-but-climate-change-ain-t-the-first-existential-threat-b3c999267aa0), Mary Annaïse Heglar, who works at the Natural Resources Defense Council, wrote that the climate movement has a lot to learn from the civil-rights movement. Climate change might be the first existential threat levelled at all of humanity, but America itself has been an existential threat to black people for hundreds of years. Describing the calculated violence of Jim Crow, she writes, “I want you to understand how overwhelming, how insurmountable it must have felt. I want you to understand that there was no end in sight.&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;They, too, trembled for every baby born into that world.” The flooding and fires of our changed climate may be unprecedented, but the threat of annihilation is certainly not—in their discussions of climate change, both Wallace-Wells and Salamon refer to their ancestors who lived through the Holocaust. Put in this light, the response of quiet climate denialism—not disbelief in the phenomenon but the choice to bury one’s head in the sand because thinking about it is too unpleasant—is not just untenable but childish. As Heglar writes, “You don’t fight something like that because you think you will win. You fight because you have to.”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAbout halfway through “The Uninhabitable Earth,” Wallace-Wells pauses to give his “brave reader” a small pat on the back for making it through what would be “enough horror to induce a panic attack in even the most optimistic.” When I started reading the book, the experience was shockingly physical. My heart beat faster as I was reading about the disasters to come. My eyes filled with tears as I tracked Wallace-Wells’s climate timelines with the coming decades of my life, or those of the children I might have.  But as I read on, in the course of several days, I became acclimated. I could read it with my mind, without my fight-or-flight systems getting in the way. This felt strangely empowering.\n\nWallace-Wells writes that the past century of fossil-fuel extraction and industrial capitalism has enabled a life style I enjoy—that this very process “made middle-class-ness possible” for billions of people.” Yet, at the same time, it is a system that must be radically overhauled. Modern people have a tendency, he writes, to see human systems as more inviolable than natural ones. And so “renovating capitalism so that it doesn’t reward fossil fuel extraction can seem unlikelier than suspending sulfur in the air to dye the sky red and cool the planet off by a degree or two.” It’s why creating global factories to suck carbon out of the atmosphere might appear to be easier than simply ending fossil-fuel subsidies, he writes. These are the competing truths we have to integrate: a livable world is incompatible with fossil fuels, and fossil fuels made the world we live in.\n\nDecarbonizing the economy will be difficult, but it must be done. It will be hard—but not as hard as surviving the catalogue of disasters that will befall us if we don’t. This is, to my mind, the great strength of Wallace-Wells’s approach to storytelling. The thing to grieve, then, is not the Earth’s habitable climate but, instead, the century of carefree car-driving and reckless deforestation, the years of eating meat with abandon and inexpensively flying around the world—and the massive economic growth that this system has enabled. Overhauling the fossil-fuel economy will represent a true loss, but its sacrifices will be nowhere near the alternative. The process is subject to all matter of difficulties: the problem of collective action, scientific uncertainty, technological challenges, political mobilization, and many others. But to do anything less is to go insane.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate Change","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"climate-change"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Climate Change","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"climate-change"},{"id":"5c2e1c9722d4972cd5b832b5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c9722d4972cd5b832b5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Book Reviews","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"book-reviews"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Book Reviews","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"book-reviews"},{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Psychology","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"psychology"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Psychology","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"psychology"}],"sections":[{"id":"596e656cd1f51261132e868e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"596e656cd1f51261132e868e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elements","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elements"},{"id":"5904126272dadf5d0a508802","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Elements","parent":[{"id":"5904126272dadf5d0a508802","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"elements"}]},"channel":"Science","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5910a7d92e2e17730741c744","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/rachel-riederer","email":"","name":"Rachel Riederer","socialMedia":[],"title":"Rachel Riederer is a member of The New Yorker’s editorial staff.

Brand had an interest in using genetic technology for conservation, and when Church said that he read and wrote DNA, Brand told me, “that got my attention.” Reading DNA had been done before, but writing DNA was something new. The two hit it off and have been collaborating on a project to resurrect the woolly mammoth, the giant Arctic elephant that went extinct ten thousand years ago. Church is a pioneer in genetic technology—he helped develop the *CRISPR*{:.small}-Cas9 technology that a researcher in China recently used on the world’s first [genetically edited newborns](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/he-jiankui-and-the-implications-of-experimenting-with-genetically-edited-babies)—and, in his lab, scientists are working on bringing the prehistoric pachyderm back from extinction. The process would involve adding certain mammoth genetic adaptations, like a long, dense pelt and layers of insulating fat, to the DNA of Asian elephants, which share more than ninety-nine per cent of their DNA with their extinct cousins. Church and Brand have a vision of herds of future mammoths grazing the steppes of the far north. \n\nChurch’s woolly mammoth research is just one of several de-extinction projects—there are about ten underway now—that aim to use genetics to restore lost species. In her book “[The Re-Origin of Species](https://www.amazon.com/Re-Origin-Species-second-extinct-animals/dp/194753436X),” the Swedish science journalist Torill Kornfeldt travels the world meeting the scientists and conservationists involved in this movement. In California, she talks with Ben Novak, a scientist obsessed with bringing back the passenger pigeon—a bird that once travelled in flocks that were so giant and dense, Novak tells her, that they “swept through the landscape, with the same effect as forest fires.” In upstate New York, a researcher is working toward restoring the American chestnut, which was decimated by blight in the late eighteen-hundreds. Until then, chestnuts were so prevalent in the eastern half of the United States that, when their white blossoms fell in the spring, the hillsides looked like they were covered in snow; in the fall, their sweet, starchy nuts served as a free, abundant harvest. At Australia’s Sea Simulator aquarium, resurrection scientists are working on coral, which faces an existential threat from the rapid warming and acidifying of ocean waters. These researchers want to help coral avoid extinction by “trying to nudge evolution,” imbuing them with traits that will allow them to survive the hotter oceans of the future. \n\nSome of the projects Kornfeldt writes about are incredibly compelling, given that we are living through a [mass-extinction event](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/25/the-sixth-extinction) that threatens the stability of the world’s ecosystems. But de-extinction’s appeal also works on a much smaller scale: who wouldn’t want to restore the beautiful chestnut to its former, generous glory? It disappeared from the Eastern forests so recently that, in some places, intact root systems still push up new saplings that grow briefly before succumbing to the blight that still lives in other, unaffected trees. And Kornfeldt’s account of seeing one of the last living northern white rhinoceroses—an elderly female called Nola, lumbering around her zoo enclosure, rotund and majestic—frames de-extinction as not just an ecological service but a rescue mission for individual creatures. By the time the book went to press, Nola had died, but cells of some of the last of her kind live on in the Frozen Zoo, a San Diego facility where eggs, sperm, and embryos from thousands of threatened or extinct species are kept in cold storage. Those tiny cells contain a world of possibility and rebirth, held in limbo under a layer of liquid nitrogen. \n\nNola makes for a charismatic ambassador of de-extinction, but some of the other projects raise big questions, both ethical and practical. It’s hard to imagine how one might go about introducing herds of woolly mammoths in the near-future Arctic: If the mammoths make it into existence, will temperatures in the far north still be cold enough to sustain a habitat for them? And just whose land do these giant herd animals get to graze? Meanwhile, the passenger pigeons, which used to descend in flocks that left areas picked clean and covered in guano, sound less Garden of Eden than Biblical plague. Another Harvard researcher, Arkhat Abzhanov, is modifying chicken embryos to make them more like their dinosaur ancestors; he likens his research to “examining birds’ family tree by moving backwards along the branches.” Abzhanov doesn’t let the embryos hatch, and it’s not clear that their mix of genetic features would allow them to function if they did. Kornfeldt writes that “chicken-sized dinosaur pets might sell like hot cakes” and “be delightfully harmless”—but if such animals were to be brought into the world, what would they be? It’s impossible not to think of Frankenstein’s monster, in both the creature’s monstrosity and its suffering.  \n\nIt’s this tension—even more than the specifics surrounding the revival of any one species—that carries Kornfeldt’s stories along: she constantly pursues the question of what all of this means for humanity’s relationship to nature. To bring species back—from extinction or from its brink—is a godlike power. Stewart Brand, ever bullish on human potential, has said, “We are as gods and have to get good at it.” He sees species revival as part of a tech-forward approach to environmentalism. “Biotech has an enormous amount to bring to conservation,” he told me. We already wipe species out on the regular, so if we’re going to have godlike power, why not wield it intentionally and responsibly? \n\nBen Minteer, a professor of environmental ethics and one of the few de-extinction critics featured in the book, points out the danger of humanity becoming “mesmerised by its own power.” He recommends an “earthly modesty”: instead of trying to engineer our way out of planetary ruin by further altering nature, we should scale back destruction instead. The debate calls to mind what Bill McKibben wrote, in 1989, in “[The End of Nature](http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1989-09-11#folio=072)”: “We have deprived nature of its independence, and that is fatal to its meaning. Nature’s independence *is* its meaning.” By changing the climate through carbon emissions, he wrote, humanity had infiltrated every part of the wilderness, leaving nothing untouched. The same idea applies here. Whatever any of these genetically resurrected species might be, they won’t be part of nature.                                                                                                \n\n-=-=-=-\n\nReading the science of de-extinction can inspire a lot of hope—not necessarily about the species themselves, but for demonstrating how relatively fast an area of science can develop. (The first genetically engineered plant was created in the early eighties. The human genome was sequenced in 2003\\. In 2006, a technique was developed to turn specialized cells into stem cells.) There’s an element of serendipity to scientific discovery, but that kind of progress doesn’t happen by accident—it’s the result of the concentrated effort that happens when broad swaths of society decide to make something a priority. In the nineties, the Human Genome Project was the new moon landing, publicly funded with almost three billion dollars from the U.S. government, and running alongside parallel projects supported by private corporations and other governments. When the first sequencing was complete, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair announced it together at the White House, using language that was [heraldic even for Clinton](https://clintonwhitehouse3.archives.gov/WH/Work/062600.html): “We are learning the language in which God created life.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. With this profound new knowledge, humankind is on the verge of gaining immense, new power to heal.” \n\nReading about the ways that bold, public investment in genetics has paid off, I can’t help but wish for the same level of investment—in public attention, funding, enthusiasm—to be directed toward the scientific approaches that are necessary to decarbonize the economy, shift global energy patterns, and mitigate climate change. The research into [carbon capture](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/can-carbon-dioxide-removal-save-the-world) and zero-emissions energy should attract the very best minds; the work should be lavished with public attention, funding, and enthusiasm. The Human Genome Project and the moon landing were the big, showy results that bloomed out of decades of research; viable technological climate fixes won’t just appear overnight. And, with Trump in the White House and his climate-denying appointees running energy and environmental policy, such a shift is its own kind of [moon shot](https://www.gq.com/story/green-new-deal-explainer?verso=true). But the advocates of a [Green New Deal](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/creating-a-road-map-for-a-green-new-deal), such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are thinking on this kind of scale. As Robinson Meyer writes in [*The Atlantic*](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/12/ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal-winning-climate-strategy/576514/), “In the 1960s, the U.S. pointed the full power of its military-technological industry at going to the moon. Ocasio-Cortez wants to do the same thing, except to save the planet.”\n\nAs it turns out, the mammoths themselves could have a role to play in combating climate change. A main reason for the interest in bringing back the woolly mammoth—or in introducing some new, mammothlike elephant—is its potential impact on the climate. At a nature reserve in Siberia called Pleistocene Park, the father and son scientists, Nikita and Sergey Zimov, are leading the effort to protect the permafrost with grazing herbivores. (My colleague Elizabeth Kolbert first [wrote about Pleistocene Park](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/12/24/recall-of-the-wild) in this magazine in 2012\\.) The permafrost, a thick layer of soil, sediment or rock that stays frozen year-round, is thawing. And that makes people nervous, because as it melts it will release a great quantity of greenhouse-gas emissions. Herbivores help because, in the winter, they act like snow plows, kicking up the snow and compacting it in their efforts to get to the grass beneath, exposing the ground to the frigid air and keeping it frozen. Inside the park, a mix of horses, elk, reindeer, oxen, and a lone bison roam and graze, and have restored the grassland by clearing it of scrubby bushes. Brand calls Pleistocene Park “one of the most gonzo pieces of science ever,” and, according to Nikita Zimov, it’s already working: the permafrost half a meter below the surface is seventeen degrees colder inside the park than it is outside. Mammoths, one imagines, would be even better snow-tramplers. George Church, a genetics pioneer and an eternal optimist, sums it up, though perhaps with some hyperbole: “So it could be mammoths that save the climate.” \n\nOf course, Church’s optimism might not be borne out. But Zimov’s anecdotal results are shored up by a new paper, [published, on December 6th, in *Science*](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/ysof-cpa120518.php), that shows that the presence of animals in an ecosystem can have dramatic impacts on landscapes—even swinging them from being net carbon emitters to carbon sinks. But they can also do the reverse, depending on the vegetation, the animal, and a host of other factors. This finding reverses the conventional wisdom around climate modelling, that “low-abundant” animal populations can’t impact an ecosystem’s carbon cycling the way that carbon-storing plants and carbon-gushing humans do. “Some of us have been saying for a long time that it’s not just animal abundance that matters but what these animals do that is important,” Oswald J. Schmitz, the study’s lead author, said in a release. \n\nHumans have long been managers of nature. In the Serengeti, at the turn of the twentieth century, the wildebeest population was decimated by a cattle virus in less than a decade. Carcasses dotted the savanna. Without the grazers keeping grass in check, an overgrowth of dry ground vegetation set the stage for devastating wildfires. When the herds recovered, however, more carbon was recycled and kept in the landscape, turning the savanna back to a carbon sink. The herds made their comeback after a vaccination campaign—a de-extinction project of a different sort.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate Change","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"climate-change"},{"id":"5c2e1c79397f5b30646d05e8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Extinction","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"extinction"},{"id":"5c2e1c792bc86f2c9a244997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Animals","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"animals"}],"sections":[{"id":"596e656cd1f51261132e868e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elements","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elements"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a7d92e2e17730741c744","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/rachel-riederer","email":"","name":"Rachel Riederer","socialMedia":[],"title":"Rachel Riederer is a member of The New Yorker’s editorial staff.

I was in my twenties when I wrote it, and out on an intellectual limb: climate science was still young. But the data were persuasive, and freighted with sadness. We were spewing so much carbon into the atmosphere that nature was no longer a force beyond our influence—and humanity, with its capacity for industry and heedlessness, had come to affect every cubic metre of the planet’s air, every inch of its surface, every drop of its water. Scientists underlined this notion a decade later when they began referring to our era as the Anthropocene, the world made by man.\n\nI was frightened by my reporting, but, at the time, it seemed likely that we’d try as a society to prevent the worst from happening. In 1988, George H. W. Bush, running for President, promised that he would fight “the greenhouse effect with the White House effect.” He did not, nor did his successors, nor did their peers in seats of power around the world, and so in the intervening decades what was a theoretical threat has become a fierce daily reality. As this essay goes to press, California is ablaze. A big fire near Los Angeles forced the evacuation of Malibu, and an even larger fire, in the Sierra Nevada foothills, has become the most destructive in California’s history. After a summer of unprecedented high temperatures and a fall “rainy season” with less than half the usual precipitation, the northern firestorm turned a city called Paradise into an inferno within an hour, razing more than ten thousand buildings and killing at least sixty-three people; more than six hundred others are missing. The authorities brought in cadaver dogs, a lab to match evacuees’ DNA with swabs taken from the dead, and anthropologists from California State University at Chico to advise on how to identify bodies from charred bone fragments.\n\nFor the past few years, a tide of optimistic thinking has held that conditions for human beings around the globe have been improving. Wars are scarcer, poverty and hunger are less severe, and there are better prospects for wide-scale literacy and education. But there are newer signs that human progress has begun to flag. In the face of our environmental deterioration, it’s now reasonable to ask whether the human game has begun to falter—perhaps even to play itself out. Late in 2017, a United Nations agency announced that the number of chronically malnourished people in the world, after a decade of decline, had started to grow again—by thirty-eight million, to a total of eight hundred and fifteen million, “largely due to the proliferation of violent conflicts and climate-related shocks.” In June, 2018, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the U.N. found that child labor, after years of falling, was growing, “driven in part by an increase in conflicts and climate-induced disasters.”\n\nIn 2015, at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Paris, the world’s governments, noting that the earth has so far warmed a little more than one degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, set a goal of holding the increase this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), with a fallback target of two degrees (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). This past October, the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a special report stating that global warming “is likely to reach 1.5 C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate.” We will have drawn a line in the sand and then watched a rising tide erase it. The report did not mention that, in Paris, countries’ initial pledges would cut emissions only enough to limit warming to 3.5 degrees Celsius (about 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century, a scale and pace of change so profound as to call into question whether our current societies could survive it.\n\nScientists have warned for decades that climate change would lead to extreme weather. Shortly before the I.P.C.C. report was published, Hurricane Michael, the strongest hurricane ever to hit the Florida Panhandle, inflicted thirty billion dollars’ worth of material damage and killed forty-five people. President Trump, who has argued that global warming is “a total, and very expensive, hoax,” visited Florida to survey the wreckage, but told reporters that the storm had not caused him to rethink his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accords. He expressed no interest in the I.P. C.C. report beyond asking “who drew it.” (The answer is ninety-one researchers from forty countries.) He later claimed that his “natural instinct” for science made him confident that the climate would soon “change back.” A month later, Trump blamed the fires in California on “gross mismanagement of forests.”\n\nHuman beings have always experienced wars and truces, crashes and recoveries, famines and terrorism. We’ve endured tyrants and outlasted perverse ideologies. Climate change is different. As a team of scientists recently pointed out in the journal _Nature Climate Change_, the physical shifts we’re inflicting on the planet will “extend longer than the entire history of human civilization thus far.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5bee0dd1050708639d6e1404]||||||\n+++\n\nThe poorest and most vulnerable will pay the highest price. But already, even in the most affluent areas, many of us hesitate to walk across a grassy meadow because of the proliferation of ticks bearing Lyme disease which have come with the hot weather; we have found ourselves unable to swim off beaches, because jellyfish, which thrive as warming seas kill off other marine life, have taken over the water. The planet’s diameter will remain eight thousand miles, and its surface will still cover two hundred million square miles. But the earth, for humans, has begun to shrink, under our feet and in our minds.\n\n-=-=-=\n\n“Climate change,” like “urban sprawl” or “gun violence,” has become such a familiar term that we tend to read past it. But exactly what we’ve been up to should fill us with awe. During the past two hundred years, we have burned immense quantities of coal and gas and oil—in car motors, basement furnaces, power plants, steel mills—and, as we have done so, carbon atoms have combined with oxygen atoms in the air to produce carbon dioxide. This, along with other gases like methane, has trapped heat that would otherwise have radiated back out to space.\n\nThere are at least four other episodes in the earth’s half-billion-year history of animal life when CO~2~ has poured into the atmosphere in greater volumes, but perhaps never at greater speeds. Even at the end of the Permian Age, when huge injections of CO~2~ from volcanoes burning through coal deposits culminated in “The Great Dying,” the CO~2~ content of the atmosphere grew at perhaps a tenth of the current pace. Two centuries ago, the concentration of CO~2~ in the atmosphere was two hundred and seventy-five parts per million; it has now topped four hundred parts per million and is rising more than two parts per million each year. The extra heat that we trap near the planet every day is equivalent to the heat from four hundred thousand bombs the size of the one that was dropped on Hiroshima.\n\nAs a result, in the past thirty years we’ve seen all twenty of the hottest years ever recorded. The melting of ice caps and glaciers and the rising levels of our oceans and seas, initially predicted for the end of the century, have occurred decades early. “I’ve never been at . . . a climate conference where people say ‘that happened slower than I thought it would,’ ” Christina Hulbe, a New Zealand climatologist, told a reporter for _Grist_ last year. This past May, a team of scientists from the University of Illinois reported that there was a thirty-five-per-cent chance that, because of unexpectedly high economic growth rates, the U.N.’s “worst-case scenario” for global warming was too optimistic. “We are now truly in uncharted territory,” David Carlson, the former director of the World Meteorological Organization’s climate-research division, said in the spring of 2017, after data showed that the previous year had broken global heat records.\n\nWe are off the literal charts as well. In August, I visited Greenland, where, one day, with a small group of scientists and activists, I took a boat from the village of Narsaq to a glacier on a nearby fjord. As we made our way across a broad bay, I glanced up at the electronic chart above the captain’s wheel, where a blinking icon showed that we were a mile inland. The captain explained that the chart was from five years ago, when the water around us was still ice. The American glaciologist Jason Box, who organized the trip, chose our landing site. “We called this place the Eagle Glacier because of its shape,” he said. The name, too, was five years old. “The head and the wings of the bird have melted away. I don’t know what we should call it now, but the eagle is dead.”\n\nThere were two poets among the crew, Aka Niviana, who is Greenlandic, and Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, from the low-lying Marshall Islands, in the Pacific, where “king tides” recently washed through living rooms and unearthed graveyards. A small lens of fresh water has supported life on the Marshall Islands’ atolls for millennia, but, as salt water intrudes, breadfruit trees and banana palms wilt and die. As the Greenlandic ice we were gazing at continues to melt, the water will drown Jetnil-Kijiner’s homeland. About a third of the carbon responsible for these changes has come from the United States.\n\nA few days after the boat trip, the two poets and I accompanied the scientists to another fjord, where they needed to change the memory card on a camera that tracks the retreat of the ice sheet. As we took off for the flight home over the snout of a giant glacier, an eight-story chunk calved off the face and crashed into the ocean. I’d never seen anything quite like it for sheer power—the waves rose twenty feet as it plunged into the dark water. You could imagine the same waves washing through the Marshalls. You could almost sense the ice elevating the ocean by a sliver—along the seafront in Mumbai, which already floods on a stormy day, and at the Battery in Manhattan, where the seawall rises just a few feet above the water.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWhen I say the world has begun to shrink, this is what I mean. Until now, human beings have been spreading, from our beginnings in Africa, out across the globe—slowly at first, and then much faster. But a period of contraction is setting in as we lose parts of the habitable earth. Sometimes our retreat will be hasty and violent; the effort to evacuate the blazing California towns along narrow roads was so chaotic that many people died in their cars. But most of the pullback will be slower, starting along the world’s coastlines. Each year, another twenty-four thousand people abandon Vietnam’s sublimely fertile Mekong Delta as crop fields are polluted with salt. As sea ice melts along the Alaskan coast, there is nothing to protect towns, cities, and native villages from the waves. In Mexico Beach, Florida, which was all but eradicated by Hurricane Michael, a resident told the Washington _Post_, “The older people can’t rebuild; it’s too late in their lives. Who is going to be left? Who is going to care?”\n\nIn one week at the end of last year, I read accounts from Louisiana, where government officials were finalizing a plan to relocate thousands of people threatened by the rising Gulf (“Not everybody is going to live where they are now and continue their way of life, and that is a terrible, and emotional, reality to face,” [one state official said](http://secure-web.cisco.com/1_tRM6HBY6EwKu7mvGrG23MSX97cwLfmySPPikYtScLd6uyvbIIOeZnNNjeJGm3Bwmlsgj87NbNt3M1_9ippbnWu9WEXdVpTwpYPpRCQHBXumVgpP5RMBWaAsdidEsQnhVDxr8vVZJGZCnI81bnTvSBckwGlxIH31Gl7WL0aitYszQ-_VSZBOf6PqlG1da2i8w21lnLyPjO5hLrMY38L6KlBIvDyM9fULTllxvepiXOGMmWlbGlCbXQcUicPursrSARM3TBALJ4eTlDiOzR_dy_LPLC3hlsSwJHjwKY-FmhShjE3oBu2u8TwQ0S98SqMLEjuvAkAPEVSy6o6heTZgStH5Szp-kReFmy_YlEpO1A3_nVgjaN1r40ot220rAb4r/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2017-12-22%2Flouisiana-sinking-fast-prepares-to-empty-out-its-coastal-plain)); from Hawaii, where, according to a new study, thirty-eight miles of coastal roads will become impassable in the next few decades; and from Jakarta, a city with a population of ten million, where a rising Java Sea had flooded the streets. In the first days of 2018, a nor’easter flooded downtown Boston; dumpsters and cars floated through the financial district. “If anyone wants to question global warming, just see where the flood zones are,” Marty Walsh, the mayor of Boston, told reporters. “Some of those zones did not flood thirty years ago.”\n\nAccording to a study from the United Kingdom’s National Oceanography Centre last summer, the damage caused by rising sea levels will cost the world as much as fourteen trillion dollars a year by 2100, if the U.N. targets aren’t met. “Like it or not, we will retreat from most of the world’s non-urban shorelines in the not very distant future,” Orrin Pilkey, an expert on sea levels at Duke University, wrote in his book “Retreat from a Rising Sea.” “We can plan now and retreat in a strategic and calculated fashion, or we can worry about it later and retreat in tactical disarray in response to devastating storms. In other words, we can walk away methodically, or we can flee in panic.”\n\nBut it’s not clear where to go. As with the rising seas, rising temperatures have begun to narrow the margins of our inhabitation, this time in the hot continental interiors. Nine of the ten deadliest heat waves in human history have occurred since 2000\\. In India, the rise in temperature since 1960 (about one degree Fahrenheit) has increased the chance of mass heat-related deaths by a hundred and fifty per cent. The summer of 2018 was the hottest ever measured in certain areas. For a couple of days in June, temperatures in cities in Pakistan and Iran peaked at slightly above a hundred and twenty-nine degrees Fahrenheit, the highest reliably recorded temperatures ever measured. The same heat wave, nearer the shore of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, combined triple-digit temperatures with soaring humidity levels to produce a heat index of more than a hundred and forty degrees Fahrenheit. June 26th was the warmest night in history, with the mercury in one Omani city remaining above a hundred and nine degrees Fahrenheit until morning. In July, a heat wave in Montreal killed more than seventy people, and Death Valley, which often sets American records, registered the hottest month ever seen on our planet. Africa recorded its highest temperature in June, the Korean Peninsula in July, and Europe in August. The _Times_ reported that, in Algeria, employees at a petroleum plant walked off the job as the temperature neared a hundred and twenty-four degrees. “We couldn’t keep up,” one worker told the reporter. “It was impossible to do the work.”\n\nThis was no illusion; some of the world is becoming too hot for humans. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, increased heat and humidity have reduced the amount of work people can do outdoors by ten per cent, a figure that is predicted to double by 2050\\. About a decade ago, Australian and American researchers, setting out to determine the highest survivable so-called “wet-bulb” temperature, concluded that when temperatures passed thirty-five degrees Celsius (ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit) and the humidity was higher than ninety per cent, even in “well-ventilated shaded conditions,” sweating slows down, and humans can survive only “for a few hours, the exact length of time being determined by individual physiology.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5bee0dd1132d895f517cf7be]||||||\n+++\n\nAs the planet warms, a crescent-shaped area encompassing parts of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the North China Plain, where about 1.5 billion people (a fifth of humanity) live, is at high risk of such temperatures in the next half century. Across this belt, extreme heat waves that currently happen once every generation could, by the end of the century, become “annual events with temperatures close to the threshold for several weeks each year, which could lead to famine and mass migration.” By 2070, tropical regions that now get one day of truly oppressive humid heat a year can expect between a hundred and two hundred and fifty days, if the current levels of greenhouse-gas emissions continue. According to Radley Horton, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, most people would “run into terrible problems” before then. The effects, he added, will be “transformative for all areas of human endeavor—economy, agriculture, military, recreation.”\n\nHumans share the planet with many other creatures, of course. We have already managed to kill off sixty per cent of the world’s wildlife since 1970 by destroying their habitats, and now higher temperatures are starting to take their toll. A new study found that peak-dwelling birds were going extinct; as temperatures climb, the birds can no longer find relief on higher terrain. Coral reefs, rich in biodiversity, may soon be a tenth of their current size.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs some people flee humidity and rising sea levels, others will be forced to relocate in order to find enough water to survive. In late 2017, a study led by Manoj Joshi, of the University of East Anglia, found that, by 2050, if temperatures rise by two degrees a quarter of the earth will experience serious drought and desertification. The early signs are clear: São Paulo came within days of running out of water last year, as did Cape Town this spring. In the fall, a record drought in Germany lowered the level of the Elbe to below twenty inches and reduced the corn harvest by forty per cent. The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research concluded in a recent study that, as the number of days that reach eighty-six degrees Fahrenheit or higher increases, corn and soybean yields across the U.S. grain belt could fall by between twenty-two and forty-nine per cent. We’ve already overpumped the aquifers that lie beneath most of the world’s breadbaskets; without the means to irrigate, we may encounter a repeat of the nineteen-thirties, when droughts and deep plowing led to the Dust Bowl—this time with no way of fixing the problem. Back then, the Okies fled to California, but California is no longer a green oasis. A hundred million trees died in the record drought that gripped the Golden State for much of this decade. The dead limbs helped spread the waves of fire, as scientists earlier this year warned that they could.\n\nThirty years ago, some believed that warmer temperatures would expand the field of play, turning the Arctic into the new Midwest. As Rex Tillerson, then the C.E.O. of Exxon, cheerfully put it in 2012, “Changes to weather patterns that move crop production areas around—we’ll adapt to that.” But there is no rich topsoil in the far North; instead, the ground is underlaid with permafrost, which can be found beneath a fifth of the Northern Hemisphere. As the permafrost melts, it releases more carbon into the atmosphere. The thawing layer cracks roads, tilts houses, and uproots trees to create what scientists call “drunken forests.” Ninety scientists who released a joint report in 2017 concluded that economic losses from a warming Arctic could approach ninety trillion dollars in the course of the century, considerably outweighing whatever savings may have resulted from shorter shipping routes as the Northwest Passage unfreezes.\n\nChurchill, Manitoba, on the edge of the Hudson Bay, in Canada, is connected to the rest of the country by a single rail line. In the spring of 2017, record floods washed away much of the track. OmniTrax, which owns the line, tried to cancel its contract with the government, declaring what lawyers call a “force majeure,” an unforeseen event beyond its responsibility. “To fix things in this era of climate change—well, it’s fixed, but you don’t count on it being the fix forever,” an engineer for the company explained at a media briefing in July. This summer, the Canadian government reopened the rail at a cost of a hundred and seventeen million dollars—about a hundred and ninety thousand dollars per Churchill resident. There is no reason to think the fix will last, and every reason to believe that our world will keep contracting.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAll this has played out more or less as scientists warned, albeit faster. What has defied expectations is the slowness of the response. The climatologist James Hansen testified before Congress about the dangers of human-caused climate change thirty years ago. Since then, carbon emissions have increased with each year except 2009 (the height of the global recession) and the newest data show that 2018 will set another record. Simple inertia and the human tendency to prioritize short-term gains have played a role, but the fossil-fuel industry’s contribution has been by far the most damaging. Alex Steffen, an environmental writer, coined the term “predatory delay” to describe “the blocking or slowing of needed change, in order to make money off unsustainable, unjust systems in the meantime.” The behavior of the oil companies, which have pulled off perhaps the most consequential deception in mankind’s history, is a prime example.\n\nAs journalists at InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles _Times_ have revealed since 2015, Exxon, the world’s largest oil company, understood that its product was contributing to climate change a decade before Hansen testified. In July, 1977, James F. Black, one of Exxon’s senior scientists, addressed many of the company’s top leaders in New York, explaining the earliest research on the greenhouse effect. “There is general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global climate is through carbon-dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels,” he said, according to a written version of the speech which was later recorded, and which was obtained by InsideClimate News. In 1978, speaking to the company’s executives, Black estimated that a doubling of the carbon-dioxide concentration in the atmosphere would increase average global temperatures by between two and three degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit), and as much as ten degrees Celsius (eighteen degrees Fahrenheit) at the poles.\n\nExxon spent millions of dollars researching the problem. It outfitted an oil tanker, the Esso Atlantic, with CO~2~ detectors to measure how fast the oceans could absorb excess carbon, and hired mathematicians to build sophisticated climate models. By 1982, they had concluded that even the company’s earlier estimates were probably too low. In a private corporate primer, they wrote that heading off global warming and “potentially catastrophic events” would “require major reductions in fossil fuel combustion.”\n\nAn investigation by the L.A. _Times_ revealed that Exxon executives took these warnings seriously. Ken Croasdale, a senior researcher for the company’s Canadian subsidiary, led a team that investigated the positive and negative effects of warming on Exxon’s Arctic operations. In 1991, he found that greenhouse gases were rising due to the burning of fossil fuels. “Nobody disputes this fact,” he said. The following year, he wrote that “global warming can only help lower exploration and development costs” in the Beaufort Sea. Drilling season in the Arctic, he correctly predicted, would increase from two months to as many as five months. At the same time, he said, the rise in the sea level could threaten onshore infrastructure and create bigger waves that would damage offshore drilling structures. Thawing permafrost could make the earth buckle and slide under buildings and pipelines. As a result of these findings, Exxon and other major oil companies began laying plans to move into the Arctic, and started to build their new drilling platforms with higher decks, to compensate for the anticipated rises in sea level.\n\nThe implications of the exposés were startling. Not only did Exxon and other companies know that scientists like Hansen were right; they used his *NASA*{: .small} climate models to figure out how low their drilling costs in the Arctic would eventually fall. Had Exxon and its peers passed on what they knew to the public, geological history would look very different today. The problem of climate change would not be solved, but the crisis would, most likely, now be receding. In 1989, an international ban on chlorine-containing man-made chemicals that had been eroding the earth’s ozone layer went into effect. Last month, researchers reported that the ozone layer was on track to fully heal by 2060\\. But that was a relatively easy fight, because the chemicals in question were not central to the world’s economy, and the manufacturers had readily available substitutes to sell. In the case of global warming, the culprit is fossil fuel, the most lucrative commodity on earth, and so the companies responsible took a different tack.\n\nA document uncovered by the L.A. _Times_ showed that, a month after Hansen’s testimony, in 1988, an unnamed Exxon “public affairs manager” issued an internal memo recommending that the company “emphasize the uncertainty” in the scientific data about climate change. Within a few years, Exxon, Chevron, Shell, Amoco, and others had joined the Global Climate Coalition, “to coordinate business participation in the international policy debate” on global warming. The G.C.C. coördinated with the National Coal Association and the American Petroleum Institute on a campaign, via letters and telephone calls, to prevent a tax on fossil fuels, and produced a video in which the agency insisted that more carbon dioxide would “end world hunger” by promoting plant growth. With such efforts, it ginned up opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, the first global initiative to address climate change.\n\nIn October, 1997, two months before the Kyoto meeting, Lee Raymond, Exxon’s president and C.E.O., who had overseen the science department that in the nineteen-eighties produced the findings about climate change, gave a speech in Beijing to the World Petroleum Congress, in which he maintained that the earth was actually cooling. The idea that cutting fossil-fuel emissions could have an effect on the climate, he said, defied common sense. “It is highly unlikely that the temperature in the middle of the next century will be affected whether policies are enacted now, or twenty years from now,” he went on. Exxon’s own scientists had already shown each of these premises to be wrong.\n\nOn a December morning in 1997 at the Kyoto Convention Center, after a long night of negotiation, the developed nations reached a tentative accord on climate change. Exhausted delegates lay slumped on couches in the corridor, or on the floor in their suits, but most of them were grinning. Imperfect and limited though the agreement was, it seemed that momentum had gathered behind fighting climate change. But as I watched the delegates cheering and clapping, an American lobbyist, who had been coördinating much of the opposition to the accord, turned to me and said, “I can’t wait to get back to Washington, where we’ve got this under control.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5bee0dd2050708639d6e1405]||||||\n+++\n\nHe was right. On January 29, 2001, nine days after George W. Bush was inaugurated, Lee Raymond visited his old friend Vice-President Dick Cheney, who had just stepped down as the C.E.O. of the oil-drilling giant Halliburton. Cheney helped persuade Bush to abandon his campaign promise to treat carbon dioxide as a pollutant. Within the year, Frank Luntz, a Republican consultant for Bush, had produced an internal memo that made a doctrine of the strategy that the G.C.C. had hit on a decade earlier. “Voters believe that there is no consensus about global warming within the scientific community,” Luntz wrote in the memo, which was obtained by the Environmental Working Group, a Washington-based organization. “Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate.”\n\nThe strategy of muddling the public’s impression of climate science has proved to be highly effective. In 2017, polls found that almost ninety per cent of Americans did not know that there was a scientific consensus on global warming. Raymond retired in 2006, after the company posted the biggest corporate profits in history, and his final annual salary was four hundred million dollars. His successor, Rex Tillerson, signed a five-hundred-billion-dollar deal to explore for oil in the rapidly thawing Russian Arctic, and in 2012 was awarded the Russian Order of Friendship. In 2016, Tillerson, at his last shareholder meeting before he briefly joined the Trump Administration as Secretary of State, said, “The world is going to have to continue using fossil fuels, whether they like it or not.”\n\nIt’s by no means clear whether Exxon’s deception and obfuscation are illegal. The company has long maintained that it “has tracked the scientific consensus on climate change, and its research on the issue has been published in publicly available peer-reviewed journals.” The First Amendment preserves one’s right to lie, although, in October, New York State Attorney General Barbara D. Underwood filed suit against Exxon for lying to investors, which _is_ a crime. What is certain is that the industry’s campaign cost us the efforts of the human generation that might have made the crucial difference in the climate fight.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nExxon’s behavior is shocking, but not entirely surprising. Philip Morris lied about the effects of cigarette smoking before the government stood up to Big Tobacco. The mystery that historians will have to unravel is what went so wrong in our governance and our culture that we have done, essentially, nothing to stand up to the fossil-fuel industry.\n\nThere are undoubtedly myriad intellectual, psychological, and political sources for our inaction, but I cannot help thinking that the influence of Ayn Rand, the Russian émigré novelist, may have played a role. Rand’s disquisitions on the “virtue of selfishness” and unbridled capitalism are admired by many American politicians and economists—Paul Ryan, Tillerson, Mike Pompeo, Andrew Puzder, and Donald Trump, among them. Trump, who has called “The Fountainhead” his favorite book, said that the novel “relates to business and beauty and life and inner emotions. That book relates to . . . everything.” Long after Rand’s death, in 1982, the libertarian gospel of the novel continues to sway our politics: Government is bad. Solidarity is a trap. Taxes are theft. The Koch brothers, whose enormous fortune derives in large part from the mining and refining of oil and gas, have peddled a similar message, broadening the efforts that Exxon-funded groups like the Global Climate Coalition spearheaded in the late nineteen-eighties.\n\nFossil-fuel companies and electric utilities, often led by Koch-linked groups, have put up fierce resistance to change. In Kansas, Koch allies helped turn mandated targets for renewable energy into voluntary commitments. In Wisconsin, Scott Walker’s administration prohibited state land officials from talking about climate change. In North Carolina, the state legislature, in conjunction with real-estate interests, effectively banned policymakers from using scientific estimates of sea-level rise in the coastal-planning process. Earlier this year, Americans for Prosperity, the most important Koch front group, waged a campaign against new bus routes and light-rail service in Tennessee, invoking human liberty. “If someone has the freedom to go where they want, do what they want, they’re not going to choose public transit,” a spokeswoman for the group explained. In Florida, an anti-renewable-subsidy ballot measure invoked the “Rights of Electricity Consumers Regarding Solar Energy Choice.”\n\nSuch efforts help explain why, in 2017, the growth of American residential solar installations came to a halt even before March, 2018, when President Trump imposed a thirty-per-cent tariff on solar panels, and why the number of solar jobs fell in the U.S. for the first time since the industry’s great expansion began, a decade earlier. In February, at the Department of Energy, Rick Perry—who once skipped his own arraignment on two felony charges, which were eventually dismissed, in order to attend a Koch brothers event—issued a new projection in which he announced that the U.S. would go on emitting carbon at current levels through 2050; this means that our nation would use up all the planet’s remaining carbon budget if we plan on meeting the 1.5-degree target. Skepticism about the scientific consensus, Perry told the media in 2017, is a sign of a “wise, intellectually engaged person.”\n\nOf all the environmental reversals made by the Trump Administration, the most devastating was its decision, last year, to withdraw from the Paris accords, making the U.S., the largest single historical source of carbon, the only nation not engaged in international efforts to control it. As the Washington _Post_ reported, the withdrawal was the result of a collaborative venture. Among the anti-government ideologues and fossil-fuel lobbyists responsible was Myron Ebell, who was at Trump’s side in the Rose Garden during the withdrawal announcement, and who, at Frontiers of Freedom, had helped run a “complex influence campaign” in support of the tobacco industry. Ebell is a director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which was founded in 1984 to advance “the principles of limited government, free enterprise, and individual liberty,” and which funds the Cooler Heads Coalition, “an informal and ad-hoc group focused on dispelling the myths of global warming,” of which Ebell is the chairman. Also instrumental were the Heartland Institute and the Koch brothers’ Americans for Prosperity. After Trump’s election, these groups sent a letter reminding him of his campaign pledge to pull America out. The C.E.I. ran a TV spot: “Mr. President, don’t listen to the swamp. Keep your promise.” And, despite the objections of most of his advisers, he did. The coalition had used its power to slow us down precisely at the moment when we needed to speed up. As a result, the particular politics of one country for one half-century will have changed the geological history of the earth.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWe are on a path to self-destruction, and yet there is nothing inevitable about our fate. Solar panels and wind turbines are now among the least expensive ways to produce energy. Storage batteries are cheaper and more efficient than ever. We could move quickly if we chose to, but we’d need to opt for solidarity and coördination on a global scale. The chances of that look slim. In Russia, the second-largest petrostate after the U.S., Vladimir Putin believes that “climate change could be tied to some global cycles on Earth or even of planetary significance.” Saudi Arabia, the third-largest petrostate, tried to water down the recent I.P.C.C. report. Jair Bolsonaro, the newly elected President of Brazil, has vowed to institute policies that would dramatically accelerate the deforestation of the Amazon, the world’s largest rain forest. Meanwhile, Exxon recently announced a plan to spend a million dollars—about a hundredth of what the company spends each month in search of new oil and gas—to back the fight for a carbon tax of forty dollars a ton. At a press conference, some of the I.P.C.C.’s authors laughed out loud at the idea that such a tax would, this late in the game, have sufficient impact.\n\nThe possibility of swift change lies in people coming together in movements large enough to shift the Zeitgeist. In recent years, despairing at the slow progress, I’ve been one of many to protest pipelines and to call attention to Big Oil’s deceptions. The movement is growing. Since 2015, when four hundred thousand people marched in the streets of New York before the Paris climate talks, activists—often led by indigenous groups and communities living on the front lines of climate change—have blocked pipelines, forced the cancellation of new coal mines, helped keep the major oil companies out of the American Arctic, and persuaded dozens of cities to commit to one-hundred-per-cent renewable energy.\n\nEach of these efforts has played out in the shadow of the industry’s unflagging campaign to maximize profits and prevent change. Voters in Washington State were initially supportive of a measure on last month’s ballot which would have imposed the nation’s first carbon tax—a modest fee that won support from such figures as Bill Gates. But the major oil companies spent record sums to defeat it. In Colorado, a similarly modest referendum that would have forced frackers to move their rigs away from houses and schools went down after the oil industry outspent citizen groups forty to one. This fall, California’s legislators committed to using only renewable energy by 2045, which was a great victory in the world’s fifth-largest economy. But the governor refused to stop signing new permits for oil wells, even in the middle of the state’s largest cities, where asthma rates are high.\n\nNew kinds of activism keep springing up. In Sweden this fall, a one-person school boycott by a fifteen-year-old girl named Greta Thunberg helped galvanize attention across Scandinavia. At the end of October, a new British group, Extinction Rebellion—its name both a reflection of the dire science and a potentially feisty response—announced plans for a campaign of civil disobedience. Last week, fifty-one young people were arrested in Nancy Pelosi’s office for staging a sit-in, demanding that the Democrats embrace a “Green New Deal” that would address the global climate crisis with policies to create jobs in renewable energy. They may have picked a winning issue: several polls have shown that even Republicans favor more government support for solar panels. This battle is epic and undecided. If we miss the two-degree target, we will fight to prevent a rise of three degrees, and then four. It’s a long escalator down to Hell.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5bee0dd11ea357631995581c]||||||\n+++\n\n-=-=-=\n\nLast June, I went to Cape Canaveral to watch Elon Musk’s Falcon 9 rocket lift off. When the moment came, it was as I’d always imagined: the clouds of steam venting in the minutes before launch, the immensely bright column of flame erupting. With remarkable slowness, the rocket began to rise, the grip of gravity yielding to the force of its engines. It is the most awesome technological spectacle human beings have produced.\n\nMusk, Jeff Bezos, and Richard Branson are among the billionaires who have spent some of their fortunes on space travel—a last-ditch effort to expand the human zone of habitability. In November, 2016, Stephen Hawking gave humanity a deadline of a thousand years to leave Earth. Six months later, he revised the timetable to a century. In June, 2017, he told an audience that “spreading out may be the only thing that saves us from ourselves.” He continued, “Earth is under threat from so many areas that it is difficult for me to be positive.”\n\nBut escaping the wreckage is, almost certainly, a fantasy. Even if astronauts did cross the thirty-four million miles to Mars, they’d need to go underground to survive there. To what end? The multimillion-dollar attempts at building a “biosphere” in the Southwestern desert in 1991 ended in abject failure. Kim Stanley Robinson, the author of a trilogy of novels about the colonization of Mars, recently called such projects a “moral hazard.” “People think if we fuck up here on Earth we can always go to Mars or the stars,” he said. “It’s pernicious.”\n\nThe dream of interplanetary colonization also distracts us from acknowledging the unbearable beauty of the planet we already inhabit. The day before the launch, I went on a tour of the vast grounds of the Kennedy Space Center with *NASA*{: .small}’s public-affairs officer, Greg Harland, and the biologist Don Dankert. I’d been warned beforehand by other *NASA*{: .small} officials not to broach the topic of global warming; in any event, *NASA*{: .small}’s predicament became obvious as soon as we climbed up on a dune overlooking Launch Complex 39, from which the Apollo missions left for the moon, and where any future Mars mission would likely begin. The launchpad is a quarter of a mile from the ocean—a perfect location, in the sense that, if something goes wrong, the rockets will fall into the sea, but not so perfect, since that sea is now rising. *NASA*{: .small} started worrying about this sometime after the turn of the century, and formed a Dune Vulnerability Team.\n\nIn 2012, Hurricane Sandy, even at a distance of a couple of hundred miles, churned up waves strong enough to break through the barrier of dunes along the Atlantic shoreline of the Space Center and very nearly swamped the launch complexes. Dankert had millions of cubic yards of sand excavated from a nearby Air Force base, and saw to it that a hundred and eighty thousand native shrubs were planted to hold the sand in place. So far, the new dunes have yielded little ground to storms and hurricanes. But what impressed me more than the dunes was the men’s deep appreciation of their landscape. “Kennedy Space Center shares real estate with the Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge,” Harland said. “We use less than ten per cent for our industrial purposes.”\n\n“When you look at the beach, it’s like eighteen-seventies Florida—the longest undisturbed stretch on the Atlantic Coast,” Dankert said. “We launch people into space from the middle of a wildlife refuge. That’s amazing.”\n\nThe two men talked for a long time about their favorite local species—the brown pelicans that were skimming the ocean, the Florida scrub jays. While rebuilding the dunes, they carefully bucket-trapped and relocated dozens of gopher tortoises. Before I left, they drove me half an hour across the swamp to a pond near the Space Center’s headquarters building, just to show me some alligators. Menacing snouts were visible beneath the water, but I was more interested in the sign that had been posted at each corner of the pond explaining that the alligators were native species, not pets. “Putting any food in the water for any reason will cause them to become accustomed to people and possibly dangerous,” it went on, adding that, if that should happen, “they must be removed and destroyed.”\n\nSomething about the sign moved me tremendously. It would have been easy enough to poison the pond, just as it would have been easy enough to bulldoze the dunes without a thought for the tortoises. But *NASA*{: .small} hadn’t done so, because of a long series of laws that draw on an emerging understanding of who we are. In 1867, John Muir, one of the first Western environmentalists, walked from Louisville, Kentucky, to Florida, a trip that inspired his first heretical thoughts about the meaning of being human. “The world, we are told, was made especially for man—a presumption not supported by all the facts,” Muir wrote in his diary. “A numerous class of men are painfully astonished whenever they find anything, living or dead, in all God’s universe, which they cannot eat or render in some way what they call useful to themselves.” Muir’s proof that this self-centeredness was misguided was the alligator, which he could hear roaring in the Florida swamp as he camped nearby, and which clearly caused man mostly trouble. But these animals were wonderful nonetheless, Muir decided—remarkable creatures perfectly adapted to their landscape. “I have better thoughts of those alligators now that I’ve seen them at home,” he wrote. In his diary, he addressed the creatures directly: “Honorable representatives of the great saurian of an older creation, may you long enjoy your lilies and rushes, and be blessed now and then with a mouthful of terror-stricken man by way of dainty.”\n\nThat evening, Harland and Dankert drew a crude map to help me find the beach, north of Patrick Air Force Base and south of the spot where, in 1965, Barbara Eden emerged from her bottle to greet her astronaut at the start of the TV series “I Dream of Jeannie.” There, they said, I could wait out the hours until the pre-dawn rocket launch and perhaps spot a loggerhead sea turtle coming ashore to lay her eggs. And so I sat on the sand. The beach was deserted, and under a near-full moon I watched as a turtle trundled from the sea and lumbered deliberately to a spot near the dune, where she used her powerful legs to excavate a pit. She spent an hour laying eggs, and even from thirty yards away you could hear her heavy breathing in between the whispers of the waves. And then, having covered her clutch, she tracked back to the ocean, in the fashion of others like her for the past hundred and twenty million years. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this piece misstated the year that Hurricane Sandy occurred.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate Change","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"climate-change"},{"id":"5c2e1cbc36cecf4019214252","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Global Warming","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"global-warming"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c36cecf40192141d6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Environment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"environment"},{"id":"5c2e1c7836cecf40192141c5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"},{"id":"5c2e1ccd2710c62d108154a1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Scientists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"scientists"},{"id":"5c2e26eb36cecf40192145f9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Greenhouse Effect","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"greenhouse-effect"},{"id":"5c2e1c9341c92e2c9b85da49","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"United Nations (U.N.)","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"united-nations-un"},{"id":"5c2e1f9baef5062c9d94ab9d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Oil Companies","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"oil-companies"}],"sections":[{"id":"5910ae34dd6207318b5dbb76","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Reflections","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"reflections"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a78b6c4c222f03a82e0e","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/bill-mckibben","email":"","name":"Bill McKibben","socialMedia":[],"title":"Bill McKibben, a former New Yorker staff writer, is a founder of the grassroots climate campaign 350.org and the Schumann Distinguished Scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College.

Among the bears preparing for hibernation at [Katmai National Park](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/rabbit-holes/bear-cams-captivating-unedited-zen), a female named [Beadnose](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/10/9/17955432/fat-bear-week-katmai-national-park-409-747-salmon) became famous for being the most gloriously round. There was the [baby raccoon who](https://twitter.com/red__RD/status/1074347729050951682) scaled a skyscraper in St. Paul, “Mission Impossible” style, stopping occasionally for naps in window ledges along the way. (It was trapped, released, and promptly made the subject of a children’s book.) Stories from the animal world offer reliable moments of escapism—the ones we see in viral videos are usually cute, or tame, or strange and majestic, and glimpsed from a safe distance. But the animal stories that resonated most with me this year were the ones that hinted at a more ominous trend: that we humans are encroaching on nature in ways both glaring and subtle, putting the human and animal worlds into ever more intimate, and ever more fraught, contact. \n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5c1fb87a8822322ea4b3bd0d]||||||\n\n+++\n\nThe most influential animal of the year might be the [unfortunate sea turtle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wH878t78bw) who got a straw stuck—really, deeply, seriously stuck—up his nose. In an uncomfortable ten-minute video posted to YouTube, a marine biologist slowly extracts the straw, which is brown and crumpled and disgusting. The turtle’s nose bleeds, and throughout the ordeal, it opens its mouth as if to bite the biologist’s hand—or howl in pain. The video, filmed in 2015, in Costa Rica, became part of this year’s debate over plastic straws and was used by proponents of straw bans to show how such a small object, used and disposed of without a thought, can cause substantial suffering down the line. \n\nA [baby bear](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/problematic-viral-video-persistent-baby-bear/574990/) became an overnight Internet star when it was captured in a video that looked, at first, like a sweet inspirational tale. In aerial drone footage, the cub was shown repeatedly slipping down the side of a snowy ledge and trying mightily to make its way to the top, where its mother waited. Ultimately, the cub prevailed, and the video was embraced on social media as a tribute to the power of perseverance. But then drone operators and ecologists began weighing in: the drone that took the video had likely alarmed the bears; you can see the mother bear swatting the air as the drone flies closer. The machine’s operator, in chasing the bears for footage, had potentially driven them into a dangerous situation. Suddenly, the viral cub was transformed from a feel-good fable into a cautionary tale about how humans can imperil animals just by trying to get a good look at them. \n\nThe most devastating news from the animal kingdom came from Puget Sound, where a wild orca named Tahlequah carried the body of her dead calf for a total of seventeen days. Orcas, famously intelligent, have [a long history](https://newrepublic.com/article/150740/free-whales) of being captured, trained, and anthropomorphized. Their social groups are highly sophisticated, with older females living for decades, sometimes to the age of a hundred, training and leading multiple generations within their pods. The calf was born emaciated, without the blubber that orcas need to survive in cold waters—an emblem of the plight of the critically endangered Puget Sound orcas, who are threatened by a drop in the availability of the Chinook salmon that are their main food source. Orcas and their relatives have been known to carry the bodies of their dead, but such a long “grief tour” had never before been observed. \n\nDuring a year that saw the stripping away of environmental protections, one legal victory for wilderness stands out. This fall, the first grizzly-bear hunt in the more than forty years was scheduled in the area around Yellowstone National Park. The local bears had been listed as endangered in the seventies, when there were around a hundred and twenty-five individuals living in and around the park. There are now around seven hundred. After the bears lost their protected status, in 2017, the states of Idaho and Wyoming scheduled trophy hunts for the fall of the 2018\\. But, as a result of a lawsuit brought by the Crow Indian tribe and a group of environmental organizations, the [hunt was cancelled](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/science/yellowstone-grizzly-hunt.html). The judge ruled that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had used analysis that was “arbitrary and capricious” when it revoked the grizzlies’ status, and that the population needed to be left to continue to recover.\n\nNo member of the animal kingdom was fawned over in 2018 quite like the Mandarin duck, also known as [the hot duck](https://www.thecut.com/2018/11/everyone-loves-the-hot-duck.html), Central Park’s avian celebrity (and, according to Naomi Fry, one of [2018’s notable good men](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2018-in-review/the-year-in-good-men)). He has it all, really: a glamorous countenance with an array of jewel-tone feathers that his mallard peers can only dream of, a mysterious origin story suggesting hints of adventure (the species is native to East Asia and no local person or zoo has reported him missing), a lively troupe of admirers who track his movements, and, to top it all off, an ombre-purple crest. Some birders have [expressed worries](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/nyregion/hot-duck-mandarin-central-park.html) that the fans flocking to see him are disturbing the pond’s peace—the manager of a popular Twitter account for New York birders aroused ire by attempting to lure the duck with a soft pretzel, breaking with bird-watcher protocol. But with the many novel ways that humans have found to interfere with wild animals, I think we can leave offering snacks to ducks off the list. This fall, birders sometimes waited, nervous and disappointed, when he would disappear from the Central Park pond that had become his new habitat. All were relieved to discover that he was just going to New Jersey.    \n\nMy favorite animal of all this year was a seal in New Zealand, who was [caught on video](https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2018/sep/27/seal-slaps-kayaker-in-the-face-with-an-octopus-video) slapping a kayaker in the face with the body of an octopus, in a truly riveting moment of marine-mammal sass. Sure, biologists have explained that seals sometimes fling octopuses against the water’s surface to sever their tentacles to eat, and that the kayaker’s slap was incidental. But I’d argue that, on a cosmic level, the seal was dishing out some well-deserved animal-kingdom justice, fair dues for what humans have done to that sea turtle and that bear cub, not to mention the rest of the planet.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c792bc86f2c9a244997","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Animals","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"animals"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a397f5b30646d05ec","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Environmentalism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"environmentalism"},{"id":"5c2e1c7ae56e652c9027465e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Wildlife","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"wildlife"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a41e4c73c088d7754","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2018 Year in Review","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2018-year-in-review"}],"sections":[{"id":"5bfec45e7556b72d483911ef","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2018 in Review","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2018-in-review"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a7d92e2e17730741c744","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/rachel-riederer","email":"","name":"Rachel Riederer","socialMedia":[],"title":"Rachel Riederer is a member of The New Yorker’s editorial staff.
