{"authors": ["Troy Patterson"], "category": "On Television", "content": "\u201cCatch-22,\u201d on Hulu, based on Joseph Heller\u2019s novel, stars Christopher Abbott as John Yossarian, a U.S. Army bombardier whose serial failures to escape the Second World War exemplify the madness of combat, military bureaucracy, and everything else. The fame of the title, of course, has outlived the renown of the book. The catch, as the squadron physician explains to the protagonist, is that, although a flier can be grounded if he is crazy, to announce oneself to be crazy is to demonstrate one\u2019s sanity. The show\u2014which is written by Luke Davies and David Mich\u00f4d, and has episodes directed by George Clooney, Grant Heslov, and Ellen Kuras\u2014dramatizes this defining paradox, and many subsidiary ironies, with a warm absurdism.\n\nThe six episodes of the series streamline the plot of the novel and straighten out its achronological storyline, with the exception of an early flash-forward to Yossarian\u2019s climactic descent into weirdness. After witnessing the death of an eighteen-year-old making his first sortie, Yossarian emerges naked from his B-25. His blood-streaked body moves down the tarmac as if he has passed through fear and pain into a staggered serenity.\n\nThe story really begins at Santa Ana Army Air Base, where Yossarian attends flight-training school. Clooney plays Scheisskopf, who will be promoted to general before the story is over but begins as Yossarian\u2019s training commander. In this role, Clooney deploys his gifts for lunatic spurting and wild-eyed frothing\u2014the angry clowning familiar from the Coen brothers\u2019 films. Yossarian is having a romance\u2014somewhere between a fling and an indelible reverie\u2014with Scheisskopf\u2019s platinum-blond wife (Julie Ann Emery), who is like the bombshell on the nose cone of the young man\u2019s futile dreams of ease. It\u2019s a bit cloying, the way the golden light graces the bedsheets of their cuckoldry, but the sweetness is of a piece with the show\u2019s M.O.\n\nYossarian joins his squadron in the war\u2019s Mediterranean Theatre, where there are German targets to bomb, Italian prostitutes to lose their heads over, and loads of American exceptionalism undergirding the bellicosity of their leader, Colonel Cathcart (Kyle Chandler). Of the men serving alongside Yossarian\u2014a gallery including apple-cheeked optimists, hardened fatalists, thoughtless jingoists, and boys whose disposition we have no chance to learn, because they are immediately destroyed\u2014the most memorable is Milo Minderbinder (Daniel David Stewart). I wish we spent a bit more time exploring the connivances of Milo, as he parlays his position as a mess officer into great status as a war profiteer, but this miniseries already feels at least one episode too long.\n\nPlanes go down. The number of required missions goes up. The level of existential and administrative nonsense remains steady. The adaptation is often rote and merely serviceable. Some scenes are inspired in their brutality, but this \u201cCatch-22\u201d seems, incongruously, to want to inspire its audience. There is an odd sense of romance\u2014a glory beneath the gruesomeness\u2014in its portrait of the paradise that so many of these young men are doomed to lose. The flight scenes have an exhilarating majesty to them that, now and then, evokes the flyboy epics that inspired \u201cStar Wars.\u201d At rest, romping on the beach in swimsuits, the men seem to have emerged from a _Life_ -magazine beefcake spread. The color palette, defined by khaki uniforms, brown earth, and the yellow glare of a hard sun, creates a sense that we are watching the whole thing sink into sepia, as if the show were nostalgic for the insanities of yesteryear.\n\n", "image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59ea829222eaee479a4831ca/1:1/w_48,c_limit/patterson-troy.png", "published": "2019-05-18", "tags": ["Television", "Reviews", "Second World War (World War II)", "Catch-22"], "title": "The Odd Nostalgia of a New \u201cCatch-22\u201d"}
