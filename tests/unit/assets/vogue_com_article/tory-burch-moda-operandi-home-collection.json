{"authors": ["Elise Taylor"], "category": "Living", "content": "Bonded by shared interests like politics, porcelain, motherhood, and oh yeah, running their own business empires, [Tory Burch](https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/designer/tory-burch) and [Lauren Santo Domingo](https://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/lauren-santo-domingo) have been friends for years. Now, they\u2019re also creative collaborators.\n\nToday, Tory Burch Home launches on [ModaOperandi.com.](https://www.modaoperandi.com/home) In addition to Tory Burch's Spring Summer 2019 collection, the e-commerce site will also offer an exclusive linen line and 50 found objects selected by Burch herself. \"She always pays homage to American classics in a way that feels remarkably fresh,\" Santo Domingo says of the designer.\n\nThe linens are adorned with seasonal summer prints, such as wild poppies and garden motifs. The inspiration came from Burch\u2019s childhood farm in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. \u201cWild poppies are one of my favorite flowers and one of my memories from the farm where I grew up. They\u2019re the perfect flower to make a bold impact,\u201d the designer tells _Vogue_. \u201cI\u2019m more of a maximalist.\u201d\n\nThen, there\u2019s her carefully sourced vintage items. They come from a wide range of countries\u2014China, Italy, England, France\u2014and from a wide range of time periods. The earliest piece, says Burch, is from circa 1820. Mixing and matching has always been Burch\u2019s style\u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve always been intrigued by the combination of old and new, bringing together pieces from different periods and countries,\u201d she says.\n\nThe collection includes lots and lots of faience, seashell-shaped place holders, porcelain fruit, _wax_ fruit, and \u201ca Luneville Strasbourg pitcher from the 1890s that I think is very chic,\u201d Burch adds.\n\nAs for Santo Domingo's favorite piece? That would be the Dodie Thayer lettuceware, which \"will delight even the most devout carnivores,\" she says. \"It makes the simplest of summer meals feel rather special.\"\n\nBelow, see a first look at the stylish collection that will have you dreaming of warm-weather days.\n\n", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5cc76d0a0c7c252e31be2dba/master/w_780,c_limit/00-story-tory-burch-home-moda-operandi.jpg", "published": "2019-04-30", "tags": ["Tory Burch", "Lauren Santo Domingo", "Announcements"], "title": "Tory Burch and Moda Operandi Team Up on a Seriously Stylish, Summer-Ready Home Collection"}
