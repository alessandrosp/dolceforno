As Monday\u2019s red carpet will prove, extravagant, flamboyant clothing is best complemented by radiant skin, eye-catching brows, and conversation-piece nails. Fortunately, a crop of beauty gurus have flown in from around the country to set up shop and develop over-the-top, targeted treatments for anyone planning to make their way up the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art next week\u2014and those lucky enough to swing an appointment in between stars.\n\nEschewing beauty trends in favor of artistic shaping and tinting has won brow \u201cexpressionist\u201d [Jimena Garcia](https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-grow-out-eyebrows-brow-powder-brow-pencil-tweezers) a devoted following of _Vogue_ editors and fashion industry insiders who block-book appointments during her New York residencies. Taking inspiration from [Susan Sontag](https://www.vogue.com/article/susan-sontag-notes-on-camp-runway-fall-2019) (whose 1964 essay defining camp as \u201clove of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration\u201d provided the starting point for the Met\u2019s 2019 Costume Institute exhibition theme, \u201cCamp: Notes on Fashion\u201d), Garcia is back in town and working with clients to create show-stopping brows for the Gala. \u201cThink bold, dark brows accented by a streak of white, colors, and even metallics,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s for one night only, so we\u2019ll be playing around and mixing blue, purple, and glitter eyeshadows into Chanel\u2019s transparent Longwear Eyebrow Gel for a statement look.\u201d  \n\n _Book at www.jimenabrows.com_\n\n![](https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5cc9e7e0015b7a2f84c4cb7d/master/w_660,c_limit/06-pre-met-bty.jpg)\n\nThe orthopedic surgeon turned beauty guru behind the vampire facial and cult MC1 plasma cream will be in town with her team of aestheticians to deliver her sought-after pre\u2013red carpet Instant Glow Facial. Incorporating techniques used in her German clinic, the 50-minute treatment includes cleansing, exfoliation, extraction, and a lymphatic and firming massage, all using her eponymous line of cutting-edge molecular skin care. \u201cMy philosophy is predicated on combatting inflammation,\u201d says Sturm, whose devotees range from Cher to [Hailey Bieber](https://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/hailey-baldwin). \u201cMy skin-care innovations are the result of years of research, and when deployed in my exclusively designed facial massage techniques, inflammation is reduced and skin is left glowing.\u201d  \n\n _15 Wooster Street, 10013. Prices starting at $295.

The protocol, which she perfected preperformance with Gaga over the last five years, combines a Shiatsu-style deep facial massage with a unique Japanese micro-current machine that Song hooks up to herself, allowing the electric charge to be delivered through her hands, rather than the usual metal wands, as she works. \u201cCreating space between the joints by stretching the muscles and fascia in the face, neck, and jaw creates increased blood flow, which instantly brightens, reduces puffiness, produces definition, and can completely realign facial structure over time,\u201d says Song.  \n\n _From May 3 through 5. Prices starting at $275.

Los Angeles\u2013based Pol has garnered a fashionable following that includes Diane von Furstenberg and the Olsen twins, thanks to his non-invasive, no-downtime approach, which layers monopolar and bipolar radio frequency technology to sculpt and lift the skin with infrared light to stimulate collagen and elastin production. \u201cThis is all about building skin health from the inside out,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the skin is firm and strong in the inside, it supports the structure on the outside. Think of it as contouring without the makeup.\u201d  \n\n _From May 3 through 5. Prices starting at $500.

One offering, which might ruffle their calm, is the new, limited-run Gaga for Gala manicure: a high-camp, graphic mash-up of pastel aqua blues, mauves, and oranges inspired by Gucci\u2019s Fall 2016 trompe l\u2019oeil wool cape. \u201cCamp to me means over-the-top, rogue, and exuberant,\u201d says founder Cyndi Ramirez-Fulton. \u201cI wanted it to reflect that uninhibited style we all wish we could pull off.\u201d She suggests adding on a CBD-infused Reflexology and Chill foot and lower-leg massage to any big-night prep session for an extra spring in your step.  \n\n _Prices starting at $58.

The celebrity skin-care guru has teamed up with Leipzig-based molecular biologist Augustinus Bader to incorporate his cult [cutting-edge cream](https://www.vogue.com/article/joanna-czech-best-facial-new-york-sheet-mask-face-roller) into her signature facial, which employs everything from microcurrent and LED light to ultrasound, negative ionization, and cryotherapy to create sculpted muscles and tighter skin that is a perfect base for makeup. \u201cBader\u2019s Trigger Factor Complex 8 stimulates the body\u2019s own stem cells and is incredibly repairing,\u201d says Czech. \u201cI have not seen anything like it in my 33 years as an esthetician. The skin becomes balanced and glowing, and clients tell me their pores feel smaller.\u201d  \n\n _Prices starting at $850.

The Radiant Glow 90-minute session, designed for the red carpet, combines a stint in a 150-degree infrared sauna, providing a mood-enhancing serotonin boost, a negative 225-degree freezing cryofacial, which banishes puffiness and dark circles, and finally an antioxidant-packed glutathione NutriGlow IV drip for boost of energy. \u201cThis combination cleanses the body by flushing out impurities, reducing inflammation, stimulating collagen, and providing a powerful punch of antioxidants from the glutathione IV that leaves clients glowing,\u201d says Lily Kunin, founder and holistic health coach.  \n\n _Packages starting at $200.

The pair will be doing house calls in New York City the weekend before the Gala, delivering their Brazilian-style high-definition lymphatic drainage massage technique that uses gentle muscle manipulation and cupping to reduce water retention and bloating in just one session. \u201cThe results are immediate,\u201d says Camila. \u201cThe massage improves digestion and circulation, it is great for cellulite, and your legs will feel lighter.\u201d Add a 30-minute facial onto the full body treatment for a contoured, lifted look from head to toe.  \n\n _From May 3 through 5.
